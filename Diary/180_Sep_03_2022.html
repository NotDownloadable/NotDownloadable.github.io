      Had to use the address tag somehow, right?
      Edgey, but whatever.
      I don't care.
      Bet, at the same time I do.
      Typical paradox person critic observer bullshit.
      Why am I like this?
      How do I stop?
      What's teh point of being me if it's not usefull?
      I'm always teh weak one.
      Even "you're able to understand and help the weak ones" isn't a good reason.
      The weak ones should just be eliminated.
      There'd be no problems then.
      Hell, <abbr title="We'd welcome it. We are part of the 'they' you refer to as the weak ones, remember?">they'd</abbr> probably welcome it.
      Ah, yes.
      <abbr title="As they all are.">My mistake.</abbr>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I'm listening to that piano arrangement of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBLUzDzMNLg">OMORI</a> again.
      If it's not obvious, I am not in the best HEADSPACE, but what else is new?
      I'm so fucking miserable.
      Maybe the reasons aren't that extreme and I don't actually deserve to say that I'm miserable, but fuck I'm miserable.
      I simultaneously love and hate that I can play OMORI and feel like <abbr title="How presumptuous. You can't really get it. You can only 'get' your own interpretation and personal takeaways from it your fucking impotent pretentious moron.">"I get it."</abbr>
      I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.
      That would be perfect.
      <abbr title="This is a reference to the final boss fight of OMORI">"Do you want to continue?"</abbr>
      No. No I don't.
      Albert Camus said <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/#:~:text=Although%20he%20forcefully%20separated%20himself,%E2%80%9D%20(MS%2C%203).">"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide."</a>
      Is the game worth playing?
      I don't think so.
      Not for me, anyway.
      No joy.
      No peace.
      There is only pain.
      The only reason I don't kill myself is because I don't know what the alternative entails.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/Di21lS14cy4?t=376"><abbr title="Stupid bitch.">What if what I have is bad, but it only gets worse?</abbr></a>
      I have nothing to live for.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/m0J_05_qihg?t=399">No reason to fight.</a>
      And the way things are going, I never will.
      Misery. Misery. Misery.
      Misery and Despair.
      There's naught left for me in this world.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4oYkIeGJc">There's too many people.</a>
      Most of them are <abbr title="Regardless of this point. I maintain that I am trash.">trash like me.</abbr>
      We should all just die and let the gods among as go on and do what they do.
      That's all we value anyways, isn't it?
      At least when it comes to measuring my value.
      I've never been enough.
      I'll never be enough.
      Just get over it!
      Ha! Haha!
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuVuj5aDquk">If it were so easy!</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmzBLloaTvA">There has never been anything worth less than me!</a>
      Stop pityinging yourself!
      Just get over it!
      I won't even type the laughter, because it won't do it justice, the cackling in my mind.
      I don't understand.
      I'll never understand.
      Can you believe that some people are just "ok"?
      Some people are just "fine"?
      Some people are "satisfied" and "content" and "happy" just normally.
      No problems conceptualizing their place in the world happy to just sedate themselves and live out the same day over and over and over and oaver and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again and again and agian until they're fukcing dead!?
      Can you believe such people exist and have the fucking audacity to be HAPPY and to tell me to GET OVER IT!?
      I can feel you getting smug reading this.
      Satisfied in your superiority as I lose my shit.
      GO. TO. HELL.
      I hope you die a horrible painful long agonizing death with all meaning and hope stripped away from your miserable existence only after watching everyone you love die and having everything you cherish taken from you.

      There is no escape.

    <p>
      I'm so tired.
      Now. Before. Forever. Always.
      I don't want to floss.
      I don't want to wash my face.
      "ThEn DoN't! ThEn Go To SlEeP!"
      If only it were so easy.
      If only.
      I wish my body would just give up, and quickly.
      Tired.
      Then sleepy.
      Then darkness.
      Then nothing.
      Nice and easy.
      Just like going to sleep.
      I dont' want.
      No one wants.
      Me to be alive.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl6i0jTkGuM">I should just die.</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Is anyone there?
      Can you hear me?
      <a href="https://youtu.be/c10xAOt2enY?t=168">Help.</a>
    </p>
    
    <h2>09:50 AM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      It feels like I'm being punished, and that the greatest error I commit is daring to allow myself to continue to exist.
      I hear a train in the distance.
    </p>
    
    <h2>06:40 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I had hoped that getting sleep would make me feel better.
      I was wrong.
      <abbr title="There really is no escape.">I still feel the same way now as I did earlier today.</abbr>
      I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD7Q2MoR_gY">Remember To Be Patient</a> from <abbr title="Beacause of course it's from OMORI.">OMORI</abbr>.
      Why keep playing?
      Why keep trying?
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_AZgoP2Jig">It never works.</a>
      Insert obligatory reference to the definition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEWJ-JgVS7Q">insanity</a> here.
      I keep thinking: "Maybe this time I'll finally be free."
      But, as always with everything, <abbr title="We're always wrong.">I'm wrong</abbr>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I think one of the reasons I haven't <abbr title="I don't want to move anymore. I don't want to be awake anymore. I don't want to live anymore. It's just another thing. It never ends.">killed myself</abbr> is because of a combination of my negative self-perception and my mind's ability to catastrophize.
      I can't do anything right, so I assume I'd even fuck up my suicide or any attempt at <abbr title="I just read some entries on r/depression and am slowly shifting from sad to angry at how so many people have to suffer alone and feeling a strong desire, and optimistically 'ability', to fix it.">coping</abbr>.
      Try to blow my brains out with a shotgun?
      Somehow we'll miss and blow our face off but <a href="https://www.depressioncomix.com/posts/characters/depressed-character-11/">survive and be even worse off</a> while making it difficult to try again.
      Inflict pain on creatures smaller than me by hunting them?
      One of them will probably have rabbies and some will spalsh on my eye and I won't seek treatment soon enough, because I'm prone to doing that and getting a doctor's visit is nigh impossible, so then I'll be a vegetable with holes in my brain.
      <a href="https://virtualpsychcentre.com/test-what-happens-when-you-get-hit-by-a-train/">Jump in front of a train?</a>
      We'll probably get sucked under it, torn to shreds by the tracks, hooked by some bit dangling beneath one of the cards, dragged along for miles, and survive and be mutilated unable to end our life ourself.
      I still want to buy a shotgun, though.
      Just in case.

    <h2>08:15 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I'm tired of being alone and unloved.
      Sure, I have some spare love lying around the place, but it's not the right kind.
      Nor is it satisfying.
      <abbr title="The analogy makes sense. Fuck you.">It doesn't matter how many calories there are in your food if you can't digest it</abbr>.
      I want to be in a realtionship, I think.
      But, I don't think I could even enjoy such a thing anymore.
      There was a time when I wanted to be with someone else, now I can't think of anything other than being alone.
      I feel like my romantic feelings are all shriveled up.
      I feel like I need romantic affect to not feel alone, but can't find anyone that makes me feel romantic feelings or alieviates my loneliness.
      I don't care to get into further detail with the <abbr title="This whole thing is a pity party. We're always in a pity party every moment of our miserable insignificant existence, but I guess we'll get around to more details eventually.">pity party</abbr> right now.
      Long story short, I have been undesireable on an essential level my entire life.
      No significant others or even lovers to date, and not for lack of trying.
      I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtKUUkEDetI">depressed</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eY394uqk9Q">debt</a> and fundamentally unloveable from all angles and on all axes.
      Maybe I'll read some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381269/">papers describing how some of those things are related</a>.
      But, probably not because I'm lazy and ineffective and every other negative adjective that I can possibly apply to myself.
      The world is based on scarcity.
      <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/operation-true-love/episode-0-prologue/viewer?title_no=4465&episode_no=1">There isn't enough love to go around</a>.
      I'm not getting any.
    </p>
    
    <h2>03:35 AM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I am feeling a little better now.
      I think the OMORI emotion chart is on to something with its type advantage.
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/omori/images/9/90/Emotions_guide.png" alt="OMORI_EmotionChart">
      I find that getting out of my feelings of sadness requires that I redirect them into a form of rage.
      Usually at my suffering and the suffering of others.
      There is an oscillation between those feelings and the feelings of powerlessness.
      Which, if I'm lucky, becomes a feeling of gratefulness for my current belief system, lenses, and life position, because I feel I'm in a unique position to handle things.
      Then I just have to crush the despair and frustration of being powerless on a macro-level and incompetent on a micro-level, and then we're back to our regularly scheduled malaise.
      We never quite get to happy, but we can at least get to neutral, which for me is diet sad.
    </p>
    
    <h2>06:00 AM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I think that I've made this point before, but I want to start a cult.
      I say it that way, because I like the idea of being a patron with a bunch of warlocks.
      But, what I really mean is that I want to start a commune.
      I want be around people like me, particularly ones that like me.
      I want to be able to take care of them and provide for them and give them the opportunity to actually live their lives.
      Maybe provide some guidance, as pretentious as that sounds.
      I essentially want to play CultOfTheLamb with added rules from StrongholdsAndFollowers and KingdomsAndWarfare.

      I want to create a space where I can live the life I want and others that want to live similar lives can join me without issue.
      <a href="https://petscop.fandom.com/wiki/Child_Library">Good grief and alas</a>, I am powerless.
      I need a "red crown" of my own.
      And as Dr.Facilier said in "The Princess And The Frog":
      <a href="https://youtu.be/CagSrNm1WtI?t=45">"The real power in this world ain't magic. It's money. Buckets of it."</a>
      I need money.
      Mass amounts.
      Constant and sustainable.
      And, I don't feel like I can even try to be happy, until I get it.
      Being worth -$300K with the constant threat of losing what little you have and then some in the span of a month really puts a damper on your life.
      We live in a shitty world where once you hit 0, true 0, it's nigh impossible to get back up.
      And there are many different types of 0s.
      Financial 0s, social 0s, emotional 0s.
      And some of those people are like me.
      I want to help them as best I can.
      It's annoying when people shit on me when I tell them this.
      Especially, when I'm already prone to doubt and despair.
      But there are moments when I feel like I can do it.
      <abbr title="I would put a link to Megumi Fushiguro here, but I can't find a reliable source at the moment.">Because I have to do it</abbr>.
      A few other "motivational points" that I think about are:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/55844-i-said-somebody-should-do-something-about-that-then-i">"I said 'Somebody should do something about that.' Then I realized I am somebody."</blockquote> from Lily Tomlin.
      <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4907-unless-someone-like-you-cares-a-whole-awful-lot-nothing">“Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, Nothing is going to get better. It's not.”</blockquote> from Dr. Seuss
      and <a href="http://www.zenpencils.com/comic/160-edgar-albert-guest-it-couldnt-be-done/">"It Couldn't Be Done"</a> by Edgar Albert Guest.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It's slow going, which is frustrating as all hell.
      I want to enjoy being horny while I'm young.
      But, at this rate I'll be old and maybe horny, which is not a place that I want to be.
      I want to find a partner who shares my vision and will build it with me.
      But, I have a hard enough time finding people in general who tolerate me.
      Maybe this pursuit is my way of torturing myself.
      Or maybe I'm trying to prove that I have some value or am a good person and not completely useless or whatever.
      I just.
      I just want to be loved and happy and live in peace dammit.
      Is it so much to ask to spend what few days I have with my friends and people who love me.
      I guess it is too much.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY38ZXYadWQ">I wish things had been different.</a>
      Sometimes, I'm glad I'm me.
      Most times I wish I weren't.
      I wish I were more.
      Better.
      Often times someone else entirely.
      I think that's enough writing for one day.
