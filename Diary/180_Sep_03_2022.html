      Had to use the address tag somehow, right?
      Edgey, but whatever.
      I don't care.
      Bet, at the same time I do.
      Typical paradox person critic observer bullshit.
      Why am I like this?
      How do I stop?
      What's teh point of being me if it's not usefull?
      I'm always teh weak one.
      Even "you're able to understand and help the weak ones" isn't a good reason.
      The weak ones should just be eliminated.
      There'd be no problems then.
      Hell, <abbr title="We'd welcome it. We are part of the 'they' you refer to as the weak ones, remember?">they'd</abbr> probably welcome it.
      Ah, yes.
      <abbr title="As they all are.">My mistake.</abbr>
    </p>

      I'm listening to that piano arrangement of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBLUzDzMNLg">OMORI</a> again.
      If it's not obvious, I am not in the best HEADSPACE, but what else is new?
      I'm so fucking miserable.
      Maybe the reasons aren't that extreme and I don't actually deserve to say that I'm miserable, but fuck I'm miserable.
      I simultaneously love and hate that I can play OMORI and feel like <abbr title="How presumptuous. You can't really get it. You can only 'get' your own interpretation and personal takeaways from it your fucking impotent pretentious moron.">"I get it."</abbr>
      I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.
      That would be perfect.
      <abbr title="This is a reference to the final boss fight of OMORI">"Do you want to continue?"</abbr>
      No. No I don't.
      Albert Camus said <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/#:~:text=Although%20he%20forcefully%20separated%20himself,%E2%80%9D%20(MS%2C%203).">"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide."</a>
      Is the game worth playing?
      I don't think so.
      Not for me, anyway.
      No joy.
      No peace.
      There is only pain.
      The only reason I don't kill myself is because I don't know what the alternative entails.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/Di21lS14cy4?t=376"><abbr title="Stupid bitch.">What if what I have is bad, but it only gets worse?</abbr></a>
      I have nothing to live for.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/m0J_05_qihg?t=399">No reason to fight.</a>
      And the way things are going, I never will.
      Misery. Misery. Misery.
      Misery and Despair.
      There's naught left for me in this world.

      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4oYkIeGJc">There's too many people.</a>
      Most of them are <abbr title="Regardless of this point. I maintain that I am trash.">trash like me.</abbr>
      We should all just die and let the gods among as go on and do what they do.
      That's all we value anyways, isn't it?
      At least when it comes to measuring my value.
      I've never been enough.
      I'll never be enough.
      Just get over it!
      Ha! Haha!
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuVuj5aDquk">If it were so easy!</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmzBLloaTvA">There has never been anything worth less than me!</a>
      Stop pityinging yourself!
      Just get over it!
      I won't even type the laughter, because it won't do it justice, the cackling in my mind.
      I don't understand.
      I'll never understand.
      Can you believe that some people are just "ok"?
      Some people are just "fine"?
      Some people are "satisfied" and "content" and "happy" just normally.
      No problems conceptualizing their place in the world happy to just sedate themselves and live out the same day over and over and over and oaver and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again and again and agian until they're fukcing dead!?
      Can you believe such people exist and have the fucking audacity to be HAPPY and to tell me to GET OVER IT!?
      I can feel you getting smug reading this.
      Satisfied in your superiority as I lose my shit.
      GO. TO. HELL.
      I hope you die a horrible painful long agonizing death with all meaning and hope stripped away from your miserable existence only after watching everyone you love die and having everything you cherish taken from you.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">I can only hope you live in such interesting times.</a>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/2DPkH1QyDH8?t=298">I feel sick.</a>
      There is no escape.

    <p>
      I'm so tired.
      Now. Before. Forever. Always.
      I don't want to floss.
      I don't want to wash my face.
      "ThEn DoN't! ThEn Go To SlEeP!"
      If only it were so easy.
      If only.
      I wish my body would just give up, and quickly.
      Tired.
      Then sleepy.
      Then darkness.
      Then nothing.
      Nice and easy.
      Just like going to sleep.
      I dont' want.
      No one wants.
      Me to be alive.
