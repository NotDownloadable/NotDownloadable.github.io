      Had to use the address tag somehow, right?
      Edgey, but whatever.
      I don't care.
      Bet, at the same time I do.
      Typical paradox person critic observer bullshit.
      Why am I like this?
      How do I stop?
      What's teh point of being me if it's not usefull?
      I'm always teh weak one.
      Even "you're able to understand and help the weak ones" isn't a good reason.
      The weak ones should just be eliminated.
      There'd be no problems then.
      Hell, <abbr title="We'd welcome it. We are part of the 'they' you refer to as the weak ones, remember?">they'd</abbr> probably welcome it.
      Ah, yes.
      <abbr title="As they all are.">My mistake.</abbr>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I'm listening to that piano arrangement of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBLUzDzMNLg">OMORI</a> again.
      If it's not obvious, I am not in the best HEADSPACE, but what else is new?
      I'm so fucking miserable.
      Maybe the reasons aren't that extreme and I don't actually deserve to say that I'm miserable, but fuck I'm miserable.
      I simultaneously love and hate that I can play OMORI and feel like <abbr title="How presumptuous. You can't really get it. You can only 'get' your own interpretation and personal takeaways from it your fucking impotent pretentious moron.">"I get it."</abbr>
      I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.
      That would be perfect.
      <abbr title="This is a reference to the final boss fight of OMORI">"Do you want to continue?"</abbr>
      No. No I don't.
      Albert Camus said <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/#:~:text=Although%20he%20forcefully%20separated%20himself,%E2%80%9D%20(MS%2C%203).">"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide."</a>
      Is the game worth playing?
      I don't think so.
      Not for me, anyway.
      No joy.
      No peace.
      There is only pain.
      The only reason I don't kill myself is because I don't know what the alternative entails.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/Di21lS14cy4?t=376"><abbr title="Stupid bitch.">What if what I have is bad, but it only gets worse?</abbr></a>
      I have nothing to live for.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/m0J_05_qihg?t=399">No reason to fight.</a>
      And the way things are going, I never will.
      Misery. Misery. Misery.
      Misery and Despair.
      There's naught left for me in this world.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV4oYkIeGJc">There's too many people.</a>
      Most of them are <abbr title="Regardless of this point. I maintain that I am trash.">trash like me.</abbr>
      We should all just die and let the gods among as go on and do what they do.
      That's all we value anyways, isn't it?
      At least when it comes to measuring my value.
      I've never been enough.
      I'll never be enough.
      Just get over it!
      Ha! Haha!
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuVuj5aDquk">If it were so easy!</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmzBLloaTvA">There has never been anything worth less than me!</a>
      Stop pityinging yourself!
      Just get over it!
      I won't even type the laughter, because it won't do it justice, the cackling in my mind.
      I don't understand.
      I'll never understand.
      Can you believe that some people are just "ok"?
      Some people are just "fine"?
      Some people are "satisfied" and "content" and "happy" just normally.
      No problems conceptualizing their place in the world happy to just sedate themselves and live out the same day over and over and over and oaver and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again and again and agian until they're fukcing dead!?
      Can you believe such people exist and have the fucking audacity to be HAPPY and to tell me to GET OVER IT!?
      I can feel you getting smug reading this.
      Satisfied in your superiority as I lose my shit.
      GO. TO. HELL.
      I hope you die a horrible painful long agonizing death with all meaning and hope stripped away from your miserable existence only after watching everyone you love die and having everything you cherish taken from you.

      I'm so tired.
      Now. Before. Forever. Always.
      I don't want to floss.
      I don't want to wash my face.
      "ThEn DoN't! ThEn Go To SlEeP!"
      If only it were so easy.
      If only.
      I wish my body would just give up, and quickly.
      Tired.
      Then sleepy.
      Then darkness.
      Then nothing.
      Nice and easy.
      Just like going to sleep.
      I dont' want.
      No one wants.
      Me to be alive.

    <p>
      Is anyone there?
      Can you hear me?
      <a href="https://youtu.be/c10xAOt2enY?t=168">Help.</a>

    <p>
      It feels like I'm being punished, and that the greatest error I commit is daring to allow myself to continue to exist.
      I hear a train in the distance.
    </p>
    
    <h2>06:40 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I had hoped that getting sleep would make me feel better.
      I was wrong.
      <abbr title="There really is no escape.">I still feel the same way now as I did earlier today.</abbr>
      I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD7Q2MoR_gY">Remember To Be Patient</a> from <abbr title="Beacause of course it's from OMORI.">OMORI</abbr>.
      Why keep playing?
      Why keep trying?
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_AZgoP2Jig">It never works.</a>
      Insert obligatory reference to the definition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEWJ-JgVS7Q">insanity</a> here.
      I keep thinking: "Maybe this time I'll finally be free."
      But, as always with everything, <abbr title="We're always wrong.">I'm wrong</abbr>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I think one of the reasons I haven't <abbr title="I don't want to move anymore. I don't want to be awake anymore. I don't want to live anymore. It's just another thing. It never ends.">killed myself</abbr> is because of a combination of my negative self-perception and my mind's ability to catastrophize.
      I can't do anything right, so I assume I'd even fuck up my suicide or any attempt at <abbr title="I just read some entries on r/depression and am slowly shifting from sad to angry at how so many people have to suffer alone and feeling a strong desire, and optimistically 'ability', to fix it.">coping</abbr>.
      Try to blow my brains out with a shotgun?
      Somehow we'll miss and blow our face off but <a href="https://www.depressioncomix.com/posts/characters/depressed-character-11/">survive and be even worse off</a> while making it difficult to try again.
      Inflict pain on creatures smaller than me by hunting them?
      One of them will probably have rabbies and some will spalsh on my eye and I won't seek treatment soon enough, because I'm prone to doing that and getting a doctor's visit is nigh impossible, so then I'll be a vegetable with holes in my brain.
      <a href="https://virtualpsychcentre.com/test-what-happens-when-you-get-hit-by-a-train/">Jump in front of a train?</a>
      We'll probably get sucked under it, torn to shreds by the tracks, hooked by some bit dangling beneath one of the cards, dragged along for miles, and survive and be mutilated unable to end our life ourself.
      I still want to buy a shotgun, though.
      Just in case.

    <p>
      I'm tired of being alone and unloved.
      Sure, I have some spare love lying around the place, but it's not the right kind.
      Nor is it satisfying.
      <abbr title="The analogy makes sense. Fuck you.">It doesn't matter how many calories there are in your food if you can't digest it</abbr>.
      I want to be in a realtionship, I think.
      But, I don't think I could even enjoy such a thing anymore.
      There was a time when I wanted to be with someone else, now I can't think of anything other than being alone.
      I feel like my romantic feelings are all shriveled up.
      I feel like I need romantic affect to not feel alone, but can't find anyone that makes me feel romantic feelings or alieviates my loneliness.
      I don't care to get into further detail with the <abbr title="This whole thing is a pity party. We're always in a pity party every moment of our miserable insignificant existence, but I guess we'll get around to more details eventually.">pity party</abbr> right now.
      Long story short, I have been undesireable on an essential level my entire life.
      No significant others or even lovers to date, and not for lack of trying.
      I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtKUUkEDetI">depressed</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eY394uqk9Q">debt</a> and fundamentally unloveable from all angles and on all axes.
      Maybe I'll read some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381269/">papers describing how some of those things are related</a>.
      But, probably not because I'm lazy and ineffective and every other negative adjective that I can possibly apply to myself.
      The world is based on scarcity.
      <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/operation-true-love/episode-0-prologue/viewer?title_no=4465&episode_no=1">There isn't enough love to go around</a>.
      I'm not getting any.
