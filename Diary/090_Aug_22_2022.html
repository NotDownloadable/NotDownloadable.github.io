      I've been thinking a lot about "communities".
      I'm about to split some hairs with my definitions, but it's all in service to convey a sentiment.
      I want to draw distinctions between groups, communities, and communes, as they pertain to people.
      A group is a number of people that are considered to be together.
      A community is a group that lives in the same geographic location.
      A commune is a community with memebers that care for and uplift one another.
      I've been playing <a href="">Cult of the Lamb</a> and find myself enamored with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_community">"Intentional Community</a>
      It is a fantasy, to be sure.
      But, I think that it'd be nice to live in a place with a bunch of people who like each other and work together to achieve noble goals.
      I'd like to imagine a place full of 200 people each with strong connections in some subset of that number who work towards goals.
      And then, I'd like to imagine having an array of these places around the globe, connected by trains and no more than an hour away from one another.
      I choose the number 200 because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's Number</a>, which is apparently the maximum number of stable relationships a single person can maintain.
