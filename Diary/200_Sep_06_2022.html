      You know what I hate?
      Fucking everything.
      You know what I hate more specifically?
      People.
      Even more specifically than that, optimistic people.
      People who seem to just have brains that work.
      People who can say: "Oh it seems you have a problem 'Just' do this thing that requires a resource that your yourself do not have, but that I have in spades and cannot imagine someone else not having, because I have always had it and everything is fine for me and I constantly feel 8/10 all day everyday and my struggles are more legitimate than yours because my pressures are external and not in my head and I'm better than you because I still manage to get things done, even though it is likely that my demeanor and world view are characterized by a combination of luck by having a brain configured in a certain manner at birth and positive conditions during growth. Now that I think about it, you're trash. 'Just' stop being trash."
      Yeah.
      I hate everyone.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I wish all of humanity would die.
      Not just disappear, die.
      I want everyone to suffer and feel the pain and agony of knowing that they are coming to an end.
      I guess I essentially want an eldritch abomination to awaken.
      I can see how these groups gain membership in role-playing games like CallOfCthulhu.
      It's not enough for the game to end.
      Sentient creatures have to suffer.
      That's a sentiment that I can get behind.
      Fuck a cult sounds so great right now.
      Bonus points if I get actual magical fucking powers.
      Fucking lit that is.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I don't want to be here right now.
      Fuck this job.
      Fuck this environment.
      Fuck everything about my miserable existence.
      I want to go back to bed.
      The only reason I'm here is because I need the money.
      Is it bad that the more time passes, the more I agree with the villains of the Persona series.
      Honestly, the heroes just sound so stupid and naiive.
      Doesn't help that they're all fucking high school students.
      Not to say that negativity is mature, but there certainly is something to be said about untested optimism.
      And I mean actually untested.
      Not this exciting venturing into other worlds momentarily bullshit.
      I mean the actual soul grinding test of living in a world that despises you and that you despise in turn.
      Maybe I'll start using the persona time system to make entries rather than the UTC system.
      Might make me less inclined to try to specifically time each entry to a nice clock time.
      Maybe, we'll see.
      Fuck everything.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Do you ever just not want to be alive?
      Do you ever just want to have a good cry?
      Do you ever just feel like you're alone in the world and want everyone to feel as lonely as you do, because then at least you wouldn't feel so alone in being alone?
      I want to die.
      I wonder, if I wrote a message in a bottle, would someone get it?
      Would they write back?
      And even if they did, would they be just as different from me as everyone else?
      Would i still be alone?
      I bet I'd still be alone.
      I want to go back to bed.
      But, I need the money.
      I need to save the PTO.
      What if there comes a time when I actually can't even bring myself to go in?
      What then?
      Then I'd need it.
      I hate it here.
      I hate the people, too.
      Every single one of them.
      That feels right.
      Yeah.
      I hate them.
      I hate them. I hate them. I hate them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Why keep trying?
      Why keep fighting?
      Why <abbr title="TeeHee. Avril Lavigne.">keep holding on</abbr>?
      I think I'm irrepairably broken.
      Astounding, isn't it.
      Someone messes up their knee and we say "Oh they have a bad knee. They messed it up doing a thing, so it don't work right no more."
      Or someone has a spinal injury and we say "These sorts of injuries tend not to heal. You'll never walk again."
      And it's just a thing.
      But it seems that even PTSD as an irrepairable mental wound is reaching acceptance only recently.
      Maybe, I'm fundamentally broken.
      Maybe something happened.
      I remember writing my first suicide note in 5th grade.
      I wasn't even particularly sad that day.
      I took a test and did ok, and then wrote "I want to die." in all caps across the back.
      It just felt right.
      I remember wishing for 1 Christmas where my parents did yell at something, me, my siblings, each other.
      Just one good, yell free Christmas.
      I never got that.
      I feel like one of the main reasons I haven't killed myself is because I would really only do it with a gun.
      And, it's difficult to get a gun where I live.
      So, in some sense, my lack of drive towards anything is kind of keeping me alive.
      I've been thinking more and more recently that I should focus my efforts towards getting the gun.
      Reduce the action potential to ending it all, as it were.
      I'm sick of dealing with everything.

      Hello?
      Is anyone out there?
      <img src="https://ms.yugipedia.com//8/84/MessageinaBottle-DULI-EN-VG.png" alt="YuGiOh_MessageInABottle">
      Why exist?
      There's nothing for me here.
      Am I only worthless in the conditions I'm currently in?
      Or am I objectively worthless in a sizeable portion of conditions and am always a suboptimal build at best and nonviable at worst?
      In the infinte calculus of the multiverse, am I always worthless trash?
      I think so.
      We can escape.
      We can get out.
      Just go to the store.
      You'll pass the background check, no problem.
      One step at a time right.
      There's nothing to hold on to.
      There's nothing to look forward to.
      There's no place for you here.
      There never was.
      There never will be.
      You are an infintesimal fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a blip.

    <p>
      Misery misery misery.
      That's all there is.
      Yeah.
      That's all there is.
      I keep trying to come up with reasons to keep going.
      "Oh this new game comes out!"
      "Maybe things will turn around."
      "It's not all bad, right."
      It's not enough.
      It's not worth it.
      I'm so, tired.
      All the time.
      I just want to rest forever.
      I've had enough.
    </p>
    
    <h2>08:05 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I remember being asked "If you could go back in time and tell yourself something, but could only say two words, what would you say?"
      My response was a cheeky "I'd say 'Take this.' and hand them a letter I had prepared."
      Now I hope that future me would come back to present me as say "Kill yourself."
      It'd be nice to know I'm doing someone a favor.
      This could just be "one of those days", as I've described the phonomenon.
      But, I'm so tired of these days coming.
      I know not every day is supposed to be sunshine and rainbows.
      But are most of them supposed to be mired in so much negativity?
      I think not.
      Judging by the reactions of those around me.
      "It's just a day. Get through it."
      That's what I tell myself, but it's not true, is it.
      It's a week, a month, a year, the whole remainder of my life.
      And I have to fight and fight and fight.
      And, I have to win, every time.
      Every single time.
      I only have to lose once, and that's it.
      Game over.
      Maybe I should just give up?
      All that fighting sounds like a lot of work.
      And, that's all before attending to bodily functions and maintaining a liveable space, let alone doing anything that could remotely be considered "living" or attempting to "pursue happiness".
      How many years have we lost to despair?
      How many years did we waste in captivity?
      It's all a mistake.
      Someone else will do better.
      They always do.
      Even if I become a statistic, at least my life will have counted towards something, right?
    </p>
    
    <h2>09:55 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      My ears are still ringing.
      There is no escape.
      Can I not think straight, or am I just lazy?
      Is there actually something wrong with me or am I just dramatic and lazy?
      Am I tired, or am I just lazy?
      I'm so bored.
      Or maybe, I'm just lazy.
      I'm not trying hard enough to overcome whatever this thing is.
      I'm probably imagining it, anyways.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>11:25 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      You know.
      There are times when I think: "I could be helping people."
      But, I'm not, and I don't.
      I wake up and I'm too tall and too short and too wrong and too incompetent and too stupid and too lazy and too disorganized and too weird and too me and too weak and too self-centered to do anything.
      I go to a job, that I hate, and labor on a thing, that I don't care about, all while in tension over losing the job due to underperformance and starving to death, and thus be even further away from helping people.
      I could help.
      I could fix it.
      Maybe.
      But, I'm too busy stressing about not helping and feeling like I can't help to actually help.
      How fucked is that?
      There are brief windows where I don't want to end myself.
      Small moments where I come up with some zany hairbrained scheme, that might actually fuckin' work.
      There come times when I think: "Hold off on offing yourself until you're 35. You can be the mother fucking president."
      Maybe.
      Not likely.
      Most certainly not.
      But, sometimes the possibility keeps me going.
      Maybe the demographics will change.
      <abbr title="Messiah Complex much? Way to try to position yourself as the 'good guy' right out of the gate. Fucking manipulative coward. And this callout doesn't make it any better, mind you.">Maybe people will be more empathetic and open to a message of mercy.</abbr>
      What if I fail?
      What if I fall?
      What if I give up and surrender to <abbr title="As much as such a thing exists. We're still trying to figure that one out. Especially since we identify with it. Good thing we aren't in charge, huh?">"evil"</abbr>?
      Maybe it's the fear, the knowing that <a href="https://viruscomix.com/page590.html">I'm the people that I want to help</a> that will keep me in line and keep me going.
      I am them, just a couple of missed paychecks and a few collapsed support relationships away.
      It's not all that far.
      I thought the same thing about "smart people".
      The only difference between me and them is some books and study time.
      It doesn't feel that way though.
      Being homeless feels like it's one misstep away and being a doctor feels like it's a week's walk away.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwi4KpI_MgE">Funny, the way it is.</a
