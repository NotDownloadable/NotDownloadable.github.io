      I have this issue, this feeling, this trait, this something.
      I think it's a desire to be understood.
      But not in my totality.
      Mostly my pain.
      But not just understood, I want it to be totaly understood.
      I want others to hurt like I hurt.
      I feel like that makes me a monster.
      I'm not eloquent enough to express my feelings in words.
      I'm not skilled enough to express my pain in an art piece in any medium.
      So, I imagine people in my head in pain.
      That's as good as it gets.
      Torturing fictional creatures in my <a href="https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/HEADSPACE">headspace</a>.
      And much like that headspace, the creatures are ficitonal, but the people they are based on aren't.
      Does that make me evil?
      Does it matter?
      Am I wrong for wanting what I want?
      Is it all ok as long as I keep it in my head?
      I'm so lost and alone.
      Even if someone can comprehend, they don't understand.
      No empathy. Sympathy only at best.
      Fuck OMORI.
      I wish I could just curl up in a ball and sleep and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0WsQXD8788">play forever</a> in my mind without consequences.
      I couldn't handle the pain of slowly dying like that, though.
      And maybe I feel too much responsibility for the base reality that I live in now.
      But, damn is it lonely and painful and exhausting.
      Granted that I don't have to suffer physically and can afford quite a few luxuries by global standards.
      I'm grateful for those.
      But, my kit, my mind, just has me in despair all the time.

      I used to think that all of the elements of the human experience were suboptimal.
      Useless even.
      Community, emotions, art, wants, all of it garbage.
      I think I still do think that somewhere inside me.
      But, I have to deal with having all of the pieces of the human experience, experiencing the human experience, and dealing with all of my negative beliefs regarding the human experience.
      I'm a human that hates humans and by extension themselves for not being more than human.
      Being a creature that hates itself and has the capacity to wish it were more is so exhausting.
      It reminds me of a bit in the webtoon <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/hellper/ep-166-an-even-older-tale/viewer?title_no=185&episode_no=167">HELLPER</a>.
      A creature wants to talk to god, but god pays it no mind, so it becomes satan, effectively.
