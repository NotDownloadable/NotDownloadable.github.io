      Another song for the suicide playlist <a href="">Fallen Down</a> from UNDERTALE.
      That's a good one.
      I watched a video of a single cell organism dying.
      It didn't stop moving or shut down like humans do.
      It just, broke apart.
      All those little bits where chemical reactions are supposed to occur just spilled out and stopped doing that.
      No more reactions.
      No more motion.
      Just a mess of a pile of things that were once together.
      Amazing how fast it went.
      I wonder if the organism suffered.
      Sometimes I wonder what's wrong with me and my cells and bacteria and stuff.
      It's like my atoms are in an arrangement, and most of them agree that they don't want to be in this arrangement.
      There are a few atoms that are more-or-less "in control" and more-or-less "agree" that we should stay in this configuration, because the alternative might be worse.
      Maybe it's not my atoms that believe that.
      Who knows what configuration they were a part of before becoming a part of mine.
      At lowest, it seems that the cells are the ones that can most lament a configuration.
      Like people lamenting a government or their lot in life.
      Cycling and children and death.
      I don't think my cells and bacteria want to die.
      I don't think they know anything, but to avoid that.
      But, I think that they agree that they don't want to be me.
      Maybe they think they have a better chance out there if they're not me.
      I think they're right.
      Or maybe they think like me and they do want to die?
      They year to break apart and have their innards flow out into nonexistence to be cleaned up and used for something objectively better than what we are.
