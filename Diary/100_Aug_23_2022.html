      I'm thinking about <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite">Infinite</a> from Sonic Forces.
      As overtly edgey as he is, I was excited for his character.
      The thing that sold me on him, funnily enough, was his theme song.
      When the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel uploaded the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKjOJuPjiu4">teaser version</a>, I listened to it over and over.
      I was so excited that I changed my desktop background to a fanart image of Infinite by <a href="https://twitter.com/einnharder?lang=en">Einnharder</a> shortly after.
      It's still there to this day.
      Despite Sonic's reputation, I still reserve that I was correct to be excited for the character.
      Granted, the execution of his story left much to be desired.
      His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUnhD4-oz00">three</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFucRnBpCvU">boss</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niRtBg5Up50">themes</a> all delivered on the hype.
      (The last one is called the "Showdown", which is always cool to me.)
      In large part because of how the motifs from his main theme are used to tell his story and developing relationship with the player and characters, but that's a topic for another time.

      The part of Infinite that I can relate to is his motivations.
      They aren't really explained in the main game, but we do get some context from the prequel comic and the EPISODE SHADOW DLC.
      Summary: Infinte was the leader of a mercenary group. The group attacked an Eggman base. Eggman killed everyone but Infinite and recruited him. Shadow confronted infinite and trounced him. Infinite subscribed to Eggman's experiments with the Phantom Ruby and became the Infinite of the main game.
      (Another thing I'm realizing is that characters getting power from "crowns" is neat to me. The Doctor and the Demon Crown from CaveStory, TheLamb and the RedCrown from CultOfTheLamb, and Infinite and the PhantomRuby.)
      The part of Infinite that I relate to is the feeling of being ineffective and wanting to be powerful and competent <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Pale_King">regardless of the cost</a>.

      I constantly feel like I'm less than, like a waste, always inferior.
      Don't get me wrong, there are times when I feel at one with humanity, when I feel like a cel as a part of a great body owrking for the betterment of all.
      But, sometimes, I am made painfully aware that I am just me.
      A nobody with no power, no cause, and no ability beyond fooling the people around me into believing I'm not worthless.
      (Yes, i do experience imposter syndrome and an inferiority complex.)
      I notice those comma splices I made up there.
      Part of me is upset that I'm not perfect.
      Part of me is upset that I'm not going to correct it.
      Part of me is glad for the "flaw".
      And, part of me just doesn't give a damn.
      I do feel worthless and useless, though.
      Infinite is prone to chanting "I'm not weak.", which is a sentiment I can identify with.
      When I'm not part of something more and am just me and realize that I myself have nothing, I want to be more.
      I want to have more.
      I don't want to be weak.
      I'm so sick an dtired of being weak, but that's all I'm able to do it seems.
      I'm not really good at anything.
      Most of that is my fault.
      I accept that.
      Some of it isn't though.
      Yadda yadda yadda systems in place, differences, mental hijacking, and so on and so forth.
      not going into it right now. Just brooding.
      I'm even annoyed at myself for feeling sorry for myself
      All these different parts of me constantly at each other and none of them get anything done.
      I'm really into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5SxL0OAook">fetishizing my own sadness</a> and <a href="https://movies.disney.com/inside-out">playing</a> <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/osmosis-jones">with</a> <a href="https://www.omori-game.com/">myself</a> thing.

      It feels like I'll never get to play the roles that I want to play in teh way that I want to play them.
      All I have is fantasy and dellusions.
      I google the ages of characters that inspire me and hope that there is still time to reach or surpass them.
      At the rate I'm going, I'm on par to be <a href="https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Tohru_Adachi">Adachi</a>, which is not good.
      I even eat cabbage soup most everyday.
      I can't figure out how to make it taste better without salt.
      I konw I should just Google" it, but I can't think straight long enough to even do that.
      I'm barely holdin git together typing this.
      That's why it's all so sad and nonsensical.
      I'm staring at the ceiling to turn off my filter, because if I didn't I'd edit it to hell with thoughts like:
      "Dont' say that", "What will people think", "You made a mistake here", and so one and so forth.
      That's not what this is for, right?
      This is my corner to be miserable and type whatever my pattern indicates should be typed at the time.
      I wish I could dedicate this kind of effort towards projects that I give a shit about and self betterment, but this is all I can manage really.
      Unfortunately.
      I don't know how other people do it.
      Article after article after interview after biography after conversation and they all say "We're just like you. We're normal people. It's easy. Just do the thing."
      But, I'm not like them am I?
      I'm less than.
      I'm down here and can hardly ook for myself or control my brain in any meningful way.
      I hold out hope that one day I can be like those people who do things and enjoy existing and actually participate in this thing called "life".
      But, deep down, I don't think that I can.
      It's not for me.
