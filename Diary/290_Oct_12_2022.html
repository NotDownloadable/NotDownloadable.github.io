      I don't like looking at the computer screen.
      But, I do find a certain pleasure in typing.
      I only wish that I could think and type more accurately.
      Have a keyboard and small computer on hand at all times to type whataver was on my mind.
      Record all notes as accurately as possible without speaking.
      Speech recordings are good, but take a long time.
      Though, I do use them when I have a musical idea.
      They've all been sounding kind of samey recently, though.
      I need to do more intentional experimentation with music, with all the art that I want to pursue really.
      I ought really go back and edit these entries, or develop a system that does it for me.
      Reading through some of the older entries, it's nice to see an image every now and again.
      Really breaks up the pacing.
      The browser I used had an automatic "clean up" function that made the entry look nice and neat and readable.
      I'll get there eventually, hopefully.
      Right now, I'm still pushing out trash.
      Just trying ot make stuff.
      I have to constantly remind myself of that.
      Make bad stuff.
      Don't pretend that it's good.
      I think it's good to be proud of it in some capacity.
      After all, you did make it.
      But, don't promote it like it's some of the greatest shit in existence.
      Temper your view, because in the end, your shit is still shit, even with all the effort you put into pusing it out.
      I'm having a fit listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D0QCFsKs8Q">CABBAGE</a>.
      It's just so pungent.
