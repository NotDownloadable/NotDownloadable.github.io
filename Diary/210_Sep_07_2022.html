      I cried during the drive to work today.
      I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL_40s1s8yM">Let Me Carve Your Way</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTE_uX526nE">Freesia</a> from guilty gear.

      I hate my brain.
      I hate my feelings.
      Why can't I have normal regulated feelings like everyone else seems to?
      Why do my points have to be stupid?
      Why can't I internalize thoughts and lessons quickly like everyone else?
      And barring that, why can't I have more safe spaces to practice lessons, so that I can internalize them quickly?
      Why do I suck?
      Why does every little slight make me want to kill myself?
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do good times always have to be tinged with bad?
      Is there such a thing as a good time that is just good?
      And why do they have to be so exhausting?
      Wouldn't you expect a "good time" to be rejuvinating?
