      Weird thought this one: I think that I might be bi-polar.
      I'm sitting here in this feeling of anxiety right.
      I'm thinking about all the things that I have to do and all the thoughts that I'm thinking.
      I have to do homework, I have to clean the house, I have to keep up with my friends, I have to do my job, I want to work on D&D stuff, I want to write in this blog, I want to start a community, I want to work on a business, I want to start gardening, I want to cook better, I want to write a story, I'm thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtKUUkEDetI&list=PL_saLI-LH-VrxFpFgk467Jn02i46arTyD">People Watching</a>, I'm thinking that maybe I can be happy, I'm thinking about how horrified I am of the future, I'm thinking that maybe I can make a difference, I'm thiking about how to format these pages with CSS, I'm thinking about DELTARUNE and Berdly and if I'll ever be as clever as Toby Fox or as skilled as Tim Henson or as insightful as any video essayist on YouTube.
      All these things are rushing through my head.
      And, normally they would send me spiralling into helplessness.
      But right now, they don't.
      They put a damper on things, sure, but they don't hurt like they usually do.
      And the reason for that, I think, is that I am currently in a state of mania.
      Mania is distinct from "happiness" or "joy".
