      I am looking for something.
      But, I don't know what it is.
      This loneliness.
      This emptiness.
      This confusion.
      This inability to feel joy with anything anymore.
      I want relief.
      But, I don't just want nothing.
      I want pleasure and joy and hapiness and a full life experience.
      Where is it?
      Where are they?
      Am I alone?
      Is that how it always was?
      Is that how it will always be?
      Is this it?
      I'm so tired all the time.
      It's always too hot or too cold.
      I just need something.

      It is so prohibitively hot.
      It feels dangerous to be using my computer in this heat.
      I'm afraid of a component failure.
      That's how hot it is.
      It's annoying because it's the first holiday break I've had from my job in a while, and I can't even enjoy it properly because it's so fucking hot and my living space doesn't have HVAC.

      Where is the peace?
      The "long" weekend is almost over.
      I feel no more rested than I did before.
      I feel no more accomplished.
      I feel no more pleased or capable or allowed.
      What was the point?
      Am I such an incompetent loser that I can't even pass time correctly?
      Fuck.
      Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck me.
      God Dammit.
      Fucking idiot.
      I want to die.
      There is no escape.
      There is never an escape.
      It never ends.
      Obligation after obligation.
      Unfortunality after unfortunality.
