    <h2>08:00 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I am looking for something.
      But, I don't know what it is.
      This loneliness.
      This emptiness.
      This confusion.
      This inability to feel joy with anything anymore.
      I want relief.
      But, I don't just want nothing.
      I want pleasure and joy and hapiness and a full life experience.
      Where is it?
      Where are they?
      Am I alone?
      Is that how it always was?
      Is that how it will always be?
      Is this it?
      I'm so tired all the time.
      It's always too hot or too cold.
      I just need something.

      It is so prohibitively hot.
      It feels dangerous to be using my computer in this heat.
      I'm afraid of a component failure.
      That's how hot it is.
      It's annoying because it's the first holiday break I've had from my job in a while, and I can't even enjoy it properly because it's so fucking hot and my living space doesn't have HVAC.

    <h2>12:20 AM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      Where is the peace?
      The "long" weekend is almost over.
      I feel no more rested than I did before.
      I feel no more accomplished.
      I feel no more pleased or capable or allowed.
      What was the point?
      Am I such an incompetent loser that I can't even pass time correctly?
      Fuck.
      Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck me.
      God Dammit.
      Fucking idiot.
      I want to die.
      There is no escape.
      There is never an escape.
      It never ends.
      Obligation after obligation.
      Unfortunality after unfortunality.

      I hear them.
      Families.
      Friends.
      Lovers.
      Their racous laughter and unabashed enjoyment of each others' company.
      Here I am alone.
      Tortured by my thoughts and feelings.
      The paradoxes and complexities of my makeup.
      Being a complex creature and shaming myself for daring to believe that.
      I don't want to suffer.
      I don't mean to torture myself.
      It just happens.
      I wonder if this is why evil people choose evil.
      A sort of PhantomOfTheOpera "The world showed no compassion to me." feel.
      Why choose goodness?
      Why choose mercy?
      Why help the masses when they teased you, abandonned you, and called you a madman.
      Why help them now.
      No.
      Wake up and choose violence.
      Choose vengance.
      Puruse your desires relentlessly.
      Fuck them.
      Fuck all of them.
      They can all burn.
      Right?
      That's the easy way.
      Why inspire when you can intimidate?
      You even get the joy of flashing your teeth and seeing others cower before you.
      That feels good, too.
      I can't do that, though.
      I'm too weak for that.
      Even if I had godlike powers, I'd still be too weak for that.
      <abbr title="Careful. You're getting dangerously close to paraphrasing a Jordan Peterson leture here.">Not saying that my weakness makes me virtuous.</abbr>
