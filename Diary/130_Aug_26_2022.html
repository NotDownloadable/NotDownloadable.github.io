      Another day another day.
      Again, I'm feeling alright.
      A certain sense of calm is with me right now.
      This is day 3 of trying my new work habit, so that might be part of it.
      Can't say for sure, though.
      I beat <a href="">Cult of the Lamb</a> yesterday.
      Fun time.
      Really scratches that social power trip itch.
      I unfortunately, yet gratefully and begrudgingly have to actually do my job now.
      I'll be back in a bit, maybe.

      Have you ever just kind of wondered?
      Not about anything in particular.
      And I use the word wonder to describe a very specific feeling.
      I don't mean wonder as in "Oh. I wonder how that works"
      and I don't mean awe inspiring like you're speechless in teh face of god.
      No.
      What I'm feeling is a mixture of awe and suspicioun.
      It's an odd feeling.
      And I don't think it's really directed towards anything.
      It's just a general feeling of freeing discomfort.
      That's proably how I'd put it.
      Maybe it's that sense of paranoia and thinking my friends aren't really my friends,
      or teh feelings of powerlessness to assist anyone or solve any problem in a manner or to an extent that I find meaningful.
      I don't know.
      but, I'm wondering either way.

      I don't know who said it, but I once heard that:
      “A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit.”
      I always thought that I was lukcy to be born into a sort of peace time and could sit in the shade of the trees planted after the war.
      But, as I go about my life, I realize that there are no trees.
      I'm the old man that has to plant them.
      Or, at least I likely will be.
      It's not a reality I like.
      But, here I am googling the ages of characters to see when they found some sort of happiness or achieved their goals.
