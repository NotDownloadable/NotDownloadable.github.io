      My suicidal thoughts and urges have only been getting stronger.
      I feel like I should "get my affairs in order", but can't muster the energy to do it.
      I'm thinking about making a "suicide playlist".
      There are so many songs that I'd like to commit suicide to, but it's hard to pick just one.
      But, I think it should be just one.
      All of the other multiverses can have the others.
      I just hope that I pick the best one.
      Current entries include: "Goodbye" by Bo Burnham, "The Last General" by Disasterpeace, "The Muffin Song" by Tom Ska, and "Moonlight" by Joakim Sandberg.
      There are more, but I'm depressed right now and can't muster the effort to look and list them all.

      Hold on to 27, you can check yourself against <abbr title="Tohru Adachi from Persona 4 is 27 during the events of the game.">Adachi</abbr>.
      And, Vincent Van Gogh didn't start pursuing art until 27.
      Hold on to 28, that was one of your check numbers, right?
      Archlord Kristya's attack points divided by 1000.
      Hold on to 30, that's when things turn around.
      Another decade to dread and fail.
      Hold on to 32, you can check yourself against Vincent Brooks.
      You can do better that that can't you?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That's what I tell myself.
      Hold on until X.
      Wait until some game comes out.
      Wait to see another movie.
      Wait until you try this other thing.
      Wait until this age.
      It's not working anymore.
      It doesn't aleviate the anguish.
      The pain.
      The suffering.
      The exhaustion.
      The call to just stop climbing and jump off.
      Nothing is enough.
      I don't think anything will ever be enough.

      I should stat myself using the Disco Elysium system.
      Maybe use pictures that I think are more fitting for myself.

      Why can't I focus?
      I want to die.
      Die.
      Die.
      Die.
      Die.
      Die.
      Die.
      Focus. I can't!
      Die.
      Just die die die die die die die die die die die die.
      I'm so tired.
      Why won't it stop?
      Make it stop.
      Please make it stop.
      I'm so tired.
      I need a break.
      I need to rest.
      Don't ask me for anything please.
      I can't give it to you.
      Stop.
      Stop.
      Die.
      Please.
      Help.
      It just won't stop coming.
      This is not fun.
      Leave me alone.
      Please go away.
      Please stop.
