      Lukewarm take: School and jobs are fucking stupid.
      You know that thing in school where the teacher always says shit like
      "Stay in your seat.", "Ask to be excused." "Raise your hand to talk.", "Follow the teacher's instructions."
      As a kid you (optimally) think "Oh. This is an adult. They know better than I. This is all to maintain an order that is good."
      And then you get fucking indoctrinated into applying that shit everywhere.
      Kids that are "good" and do what they're told get rewarded and praised,
      while experimenters and rebels get shat on and told they "won't make it" doing what they're doing.
      So you comply.
      You internalize the behaviors taught to you in school and apply them everywhere thinking "This will have no reprecussions for us later."
      And for some people, everything works out.
      But for most people, it doesn't.
      And even those most people will experience a moment.
      Maybe a shift.
      When you realize that there is an "us" and a "them" and the "us" are dependent on "them" for everything and "them" are not on "us" side.
      You might think you're a "them".
      You might think you're an "us".
      You're usually always wrong in some capacity.
      Sometimes there are "them" that you think are "us".
      Sometimes there are "them" that you want so desperately to be "us", but aren't and never will be.

      I know that that last entry can be read as a race thing.
      That's not the context.
      It's a class thing.
      Commoners and nobles type deal.
      Commoners not being allowed to live teh fullest and happiest lives that the otherwise could under differnt circumstances.
      Bohters me a lot.
      Yes, because I am a commoner.
      But, also because I am a "relatively safe" commoner.
      Insofar as I don't have to check my bank account too often.
      Now, I am drowning in student debt with 10x the national average and have to do proverbial gymnastics to avoid payments, because I hell can't affort them with my salary.
      But, besides that, I'm "ok".
      I'm pissed off that I can even consider that "ok" relative to teh state of the others.
      It's frustrating, because I feel like I'm in a position where I should be able to do something about it, but can't actually meaningfully do anything about it.
      "Apes together strong", but damn rallying apes to a cause and being effective is really fucking difficult.
      Espescially when al the apes that are to rally need support from the thing they're rallying against.
      Got to love how that works.
      Granted, I'm speaking in generalities and rpoviding no support for my position.
      It's all just feeling.
      But, as I've said before: my corner, get the fuck out.
