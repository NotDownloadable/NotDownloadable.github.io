    <p>
      I'm having a bit of a paralysis crisis.
      The label says 05:55, and it is now 30 minutes later.I've just been staring with all of my thoughts buzzing through my head.
      I'm thinking about my job that I have to do.
      I'm thinking about schoolwork.
      I'm thinking about D&D that I need to prep for.
      I'm thinking about ideas to make money to gain some safety and independence that I need to execute and experiment with.
      I'm thinking about the relationthips that I need to upkeep.
      There's just a lot on my mind.
      I had a few days where I could have done nothing.
      Few-to-no obligations.
      And instead I made plans.
      The least intensive thing I did was watch <a href="">Overlord IV</a>.
      but, even then that was more than I should have done.Once I started it, I felt obligated to finish it.
      Even though, I was enjoying it.
      Passively enjoying a piece of media that I like is too much.
      what a fucking time.
      I talked to a friend about this.
      He recommened me the book <a href="">Amusing Ourselves To Death</a>.
      I'm not far into it, but it's a pleasant read so far.
      There's something about books that doesn't proc my obligation sensors.
      I'm sure they do sometimes and a bit, but much less than other more stimulating mediums.
      I'm maybe halfway through <a href="">The Tipping Point</a> by Malcom Gladwell.
      I haven't given up on it.
      I just feel that I can go back to it whenever I want.
      And I'm not panicked by my "I'll get around to it" attitude towards the book.
      But with shows and videos I always feel lik "I have to watch it now" or "I need to finish it as soon as possible."
      I don't know why that is, but it is.
      I don't like it.
      Video games land somewhere in the middle.
      Geez.
      So many of my sentences start with "i".
      That's bothersome.
