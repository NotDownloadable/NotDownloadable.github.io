      You ever just feel like you're not cut out for life?
      Like you just shouldn't exist?
      Like you're just so tired and the world just keeps going and going and going.
      And you can't do anything right, so <abbr title="As long as you can keep up the facade, anyway. You'll fuck up either big or a series of small ones, and then it'll all come crashing down. Not that you cared about it much anyway, but still having it beat not having it. You could at least fool yourself that you had a chance, then.">where you are now is as far as you're going to get</abbr>, and you're actually worthless garbage that is stuck right where you are in the state that you're in no matter <abbr title="You feel horrible, by the way.">how you feel about it</abbr>?
      You look around and you see people just like you.
      Not fake "just like you", but actually just like you.
      Same problems, same feelings, same circumstances, but they're doing something.
      They're going somewhere.
      They made something that you liked of thought was interesting.
      And instead of thinking "Huh, I guess I could do that, too," you spiral into "I'll never do that. We have similarities, but we're not the same. There's no hope for me."
      And you think, maybe it's just my brain doing the sad thing, maybe it isn't true.
      But you search your feelings and "know" it to be true.
      You try something new: You fail.
      You try something else new: You fail.
      You try planning, you try winging it, you try different approaches, you try and try and try and: You fail.
      You just need a win, right?
      Just a win.
      But, that's not really it, is it?
      All the wins that would make you feel something are too far beyond you.
      You couldn't reach them no matter how hard you tried.
      But, here you are, still trying.
      Trying because god fuck you want something to work.
      But, the pain is unbearable.
      Every attempt is just another soul wrenching effort to fight off the demons calling you into the dreamless sleep, while trying to make some forward progress.
      While trying to do something meaningful.
      While trying to be more than some sad fuck sitting on the corner at night desperate for a hug.
      Trying to matter.
      Trying to make people care about you.
      Trying to just go the fuck to sleep.
      There's no way out of your own head.
      You have to get your head out of you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can't feel love.
      Joy is too fleeting to be worth it.
      You ask your peers "How are you out of 10?"
      <abbr title="I hate that the number is 7. Some stupid psychology shit about it being common or whatever the fuck. But that's how it's panned out so far.">And none of them says a number below 7</abbr>.
      But you.
      You. You. You.
      Your number is usually a 2.
      And you wonder: how?
      How in the fuck can these people be so god dammed "ok"?
      Where did you go wrong?
      What did you do?
      What happened?
      <abbr title="Kill yourself.">How did you fuck yourself up so fucking badly?</abbr>
      Was there ever a time when things were fine?
      Were things ever "ok"?
      Weren't you smart at some point?
      <abbr title="Weak. Stupid.">Wasn't there a time when you could do things?</abbr>
      Allthose struggles with the simplest of things.
      And now you're here in teh "real world" and it sucks.
      You won't survive here.
      You can't survive here.
      Everyone is better than you.
      Everyone.
      Even if we engage in good faith and not talk about literally "everyone on the planet", everyone that matters is better than you.
      You are at the bottom of your own social sphere and every sphere that that sphere intersects.
      Socially. Emotionally. Intellectually. Financially.
      All of it.
      You're the bottom.
      You're not interesting or funny, or anything, and you definitely aren't making anyone cum.
      How did we get here?
      Why do we always hesitate to check out?
      Just jump.
      The hesitation you feel on the way out will be no different thatn the rest of it.
      Just get it over with.
      Rigorous planning is what works, right?
      Stop whining and do that.
      You're such a fucking baby.
      Writing in a paper diary wasn't enough, so you make this hsit with the hopes tha tsomeone will stumble across it and give a damn.
      That's not how things work fucking fool.
      Messages in bottles rarely get recovered, and even then almost never by who you would want to receive them.

      When did thinking become so difficult?
      How did it become so difficult?
      Why did it become so difficult?
      We used to like thinking, right?
      Didn't we?
      What happened?
      How did we end up here like this?
      Was it inevitable?
      Can we fix it?
      Are we too broken to fix it?
      Why is it always like this?
      Why can't we enjoy anything?
      Why won't everything just stop?
      Just stop.
      Please stop.
      I don't want to be eighty, yet.
      I don't want to be eighty ever.
      I. I. I.
      I'm not ready.
      I'm never ready.
      I've never been ready.
      I'll never be ready.
      It's all a fiasco.
      I'm a mistake.
      I'm goin gto die toothless and uloved and alone and uncared for in pain with missing teeth in an alleyway.
      Wondering where all the time went.
      That's all existence is now.
      Time whizzing by and me wondering where it went.
      Where did the last 3 years go?
      What am I supposed to do with the next3?
      What can I do with the next 3?
      Will I be alone for all of them?
      What can I do to not be?
      Will I be broke?
      In pain? Miserable?
      In those next 3 years?
      What can I do to not be?
      What do I have to do to not be?
      I can't. I can't. I can;t. Ican't.
      I'm too broken.
      Even if Iknew what to do, I couldn't do it, could I?
      No wins.
      Only losses.
      Only failure.
      That's all I've been from teh start and teh facade is breaking down.
      I was never smart.
      I've never been good at anything.
      I have no value.
      i'm worthless.
      Useless.
      Even my organs aren't worth transplanting.
      I'm a waste.
      What's wrong with me?
      What did I do?
      What did i do?
      I thought I wasn't so bad.
      Wasn't I?
      Was I really that bad?
      Am I really that bad?
      It just keeps coming and coming and coming.
      I should throw myself away.
