      Writing these entries is kind of "fun".
      That's not the most accurate word, but it's the one I have for now.
      I derive some sense of satisfaction from it, but I can't pinpoint the nature of that enjoyment.
      I have this image of being alone on a raft adrift at sea.
      Using a telescope to look out at the surface of the ocean and occasionally poking my head into the water.
      I'm alone and helpless, only watching.
      I used to mutter to myself, and I could feel myself going crazy.
      But now, I poke my head into the water and scream into the abyss.
      The creatures below don't hear me.
      They don't acknowledge me.
      That's fine.
      I don't know if the practice slows my decent into madness, or is evidence of it.
      Either way, it feels better.
      Like the ocean holds my thoughts rather than my head, even though I still have to deal with the feelings.

      What a strange state of affairs.
      I'm not really thinking about anything in particular right now.
      I'm just feeling the emptiness and absence of connection to others.
      As per usual.
      At this point, I'm typing just to type.
      Which, I'm not sure if it is helpful to me or not.
      Insofar as purusing my goals and whatnot.
      I have other things that I should be doing right now, but I'm on break, and I honestly don't know what to do with it except type.
      The joys of having to keep up appearances.
      What do I want?
      What do I feel?
      I'm bothered that most of my entries trend towards this kingd of faux-poetic waxing philosophical bullshit.
      But, that's just kind of the way I am right now, I guess.

      I've been getting heartburn recently.
      New phenomenon for me.
      I don't know what from.
      I think it's from sugar.
      Not sure if that's a possibility, but the consensus seems to be that refined sugar is bad for humans.
      What should I be doing right now?
      I feel like everything I do is bad for me.
      Like I'm bad at managing myself and my life and that no matter how much experience I gain I'm always naiive and make the wrong choice.
      No exceptions.
      (Looks like they gamified <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a>, which is neat).

      I want to try implementing new tags.
      I've been pretty decent about the two headers, paragraphs, and links, but I want more.
      Maybe I should just go in order and implement the tags alphabetically.
      That seems like a suboptimal approach, seeing as I should probably learn tags by frequency of use, but I don't know which tags I would most frequently use, until i use them, right?
      Of course I could just follow the experiences of others, but then I would be prone to getting stuck in a thinking and planning loop rather than just doing and implementing tags willy-nilly.
      Stupid?
      Maybe.
      But, that's where I'm at <abbr title="At the Moment">ATM</abbr>.
      (See there is an abbreviation tag. One down over 100 to go.)
      Another issue is consistency.
      I would have to continue to force the tag to be useful in the page that I'm typing.
      What if I don't need an abbreviation?
      Maybe i can just use it as a cheap version of Nicky Case's Nutshell.
      Or perhaps I can just add <abbr title="Like this one.">stupid little blurbs</abbr> through out the work.
      What does it matter how I use the tags so long as I use them an sear them into my brain though repetition, right?
      What does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5IYT9FdTRk"><abbr title="REALITY IS AN ILLUSION, THE UNIVERSE IS A HOLOGRAM, BUY GOLD!">reality</abbr></a> care about how the tool is intended to be used?
    </p>

      The abbrevition tag may have been created to allow users to read abbreviations at a glance by hovering over the text in question.
      But, I can use it here for the purpose of voicing my <abbr title="I am extrememly zealous and afraid, I hate everything, and I believe that anything we produce is stupid and a waste of time. Nothing is worth the effort. We should die.">inner critic</a>.
      I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pymojkDct2A">video</a> that proposed that one aspect of madness is "Externalizing internal conflict."
      I guess that's kind of what <abbr title="Or maybe you're just faking it and hoping that someone will come along and watch you writhe because you're desperate for attention.">I'm doing here</abbr>.
      Damn. I just realized that I can respond to the thoughts in my head in the normal text, and it might make no sense to someone who doesn't read the "critic text" in the abbreviation.
      It's like getting a peek into my mind.
      Even, moreso than me spilling my guts onto a webpage was to begin with.
