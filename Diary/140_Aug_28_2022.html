    <p>
      I really don't want to write this entry, but I feel like I ought to force myself to.
      There are so many things on my mind.
      So many things that I want to do.
      But, I can't bring myself to do them.
      I think the reason is the paralyzing awareness of how short my time is.
      If I prioritize one over another, will I miss out on the latter ones?
      Is it easier to jump from thing to thing and distract myself with the numbing feeling of getting nothing done.
      I don't even know hwat I want to do anymore.
      I'm not even listening to music.
      I don't want to.
      That's a first.
      I always have my headphones on or am listening to something.
      But, there's just nothing that I want to listen to right now.
      I'm tired of being an ineffective sad sack, but I'm too tired to do anything about it.
      I should clean my room.
      I should clean the kitchen.
      I should respond to all the people that I ought respond to, because if I don't I might lose their friendship and I'm low enough on those as is.
      I should make some music.
      I should write an essay.
      I should work on a business.
      I should advance Stroliloquy.
      I should practice the piano.
      I should cook for the week.
      I should go for a run and exercise.
      I should put my clothes away.
      I should refill the water filter.
      I should do this.
      I should do that.
      I should do something.
      I should do nothing.
      But, I can't do nothing can I.
      There's always someone that needs something.
      No breaks, ever.
      Fuck I'm so tired.
      What's going to happen to us?
      To me?
      Am I just going to become all of the things that I sought so hard to avoid?
      Lazy, unaccomplished, stressed out, lying in a hospital bed that I can't afford with needles in my arm slowly waiting for the cancer to kill me.
      Is that all there is?
      I look at all the papers on my wall.
      All the plans that I had made and goals I had set with the hopes of being something better by now.
      Two years wasted.
      Just like the last 25.
      I dont want to play anymore.
      But, what's the alternative?
      Not like there's really a good one.
      Fuck I'm so tired.
      But, I can't rest.
      That would be wasting time.
      Not just because it's rest, but because I can't even rest properly.
      Stressing about all the things that I should be doing instead of resdting.
      There is no escape.

      So much of my life depends on the computer.
      I'm glued to this fucking thing.
      I hate that.
      But, it's where everything is.
      It feels wasteful and wrong to put it to sleep.
      I know that I can just wake it up again, but that doesn't change the feeling.
      Why do I feel this way?
      Why can't I escape this feeling?
      What's wrong with me?
      What the fuck is wrong with me?
      Why can't I just be normal?
      Why can't shit just fucking work?
      God dammit.

      I don't want to write this entry right now either, but I feel that I should.
      There are many thoughts running through my head.
      The idea that I treat D&D as a stage to play out my insecurities and attempt to fulfill needs that go unattended in reality.
      Logic puzzles.
      A kinship with Sunny and Jevil as I feel like I'm trapped in my own mind and waiting for the right person to come to my cage and talk to me.
      The feelings of isolaiton and lonliness as I hope for someone to "get it."
      Are you lonely too?
      A gratefulness of life.
      A despair of suffering.
      A readiness to face tomorrow and a desire not to.
      Power, cults, money, freedom and the wish to have them all.
      Traumas, regrets, trying to figure out how to live properly and enjoy existing.
      The feeling of forever being a spectator and never being able to participate.
      A desire to create art for the hope that someone finally gets it.

      I've always wanted to be smart and clever.
      But, I'm neither of those things.
      I'm also really slow.
      It's difficult for me to hold information in my head.
      I'm constantly writing things down.
      I wish I had a better filing and access system for all of it, though.
      It'd be neat to play a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6BKjk_2UTE">Dune board game</a> with some friends.
      There's a certain satisfaction to stunting on others that I can never achieve.
      My mind goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HfLVBQWXHo">Gnosia</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tZA3VfwGlc">Umineko: When They Cry</a> as examples of logic puzzle games.
      Catching details, remembering facts, comparing and combining information in intriguing ways to derive new truths.
      Watching everything fall together.
      I love that.
      But, I'm not clever enough for it.
      Once or twice it's worked out, but no consistency.
      I'm too distracted to improve the skill.
      Too busy vomitting my feelings into a text file and thinking about what tag to implement next.
      CSS would probably be of more value to me than HTML at this point.
      HTML is just for denoting what text is what.
      CSS controls the actual presentation, which I think is what I need to work on.

      I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GffHqfdzABU">One by Kerli</a>.
      I found out about it in my last year at college.
      I like it.
      It's one of my go to "low energy" songs.
      At least one with lyrics and when I'm alone.
      My go to piece without lyrics is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMsoT_E6L1U">It Be Like That Sometimes</a> by James Roach.
      Where does the time go.
      There's still so much to do, but I have to prepare to face tomorrow.
