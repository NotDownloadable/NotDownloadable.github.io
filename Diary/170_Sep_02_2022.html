      In the interest with keeping up with the tag implementation, we're going to use <abbr title="Oh goodie. What fun.">a new tag!</abbr>
      Today's new tag is the &ltaddress&gt tag.
      It's used for <abbr title="REALLY?">addresses</abbr>.
      I'm really digging the cheapo abbreviation tag as "voiceover".
      It lets me interrupt myself instead of doing the whole parantheses thing.
      Which, I had thought about doing for this aside, but I didn't want to so, get fucked.

      Apparently an envelope address is supposed to look like this:
    </p>
    
    <address>
      Recipient Name<br>
      Business Name<br>
      Street Address (The number and street name)<br>
      City, State, Zip Code<br>
      Country
    </address>
    
    <p>
      It's annoying because you still have to put the line breaks in (&ltbr&gt).
      But, cest le vie.
      Or however you spell it.

      I wish there weren't so many social obligations.
      And that transportation were faster and more accessible and affordable.
      I haven't seem some of my closest friends in 3 years all because of bullshit beyond my control.
      If the option were available, I could spend approximately 12 hours on a train and see my friends fairly regularly.
      <abbr title="In my opinion. Time whether wasted or well spend is still time.">Train rides are significantly less uncomfortable that car, bus, or plane rides</abbr>.

      I want to talk about my lack of cooking skill and also how I feel adrift with a paradoxical mix of calm and anxiety.
      These things are strongly related, but they are the thoughts that are swimming around near the forefront of my mind right now.
      My cooking skill is shit.
      With the amount of time I've invested into improving it, I can't make a dish that is simultaneously fast, healthy, tasty, and <abbr title="That is to say doesn't dirty up a shit load of dishes and requires me to clean all of those fucking things.">clean</abbr>.
      I don't like stomaching shit food.
      I also want to be able to cook well for people that I love or want to woo.
      But, that's just where I am right now, i guess.
      Shit chef.
      Trying not to suck more than I already do.
      As per usual, today I am tired.
      I have things that need to be done ant that I want to do, but instead am writing this entry, because if I weren't doing this, then I'd be doing nothing.
      Just trying to breathe without freaking out.
      There is so much reading that I have to do, but I'm so sick of reading.
      Learning new skills in a massive lump and not actually putting the lessons into practice because for some dumb reason "everything h as to be learned before you can put even one piece of it into practice."
      I know this to be false, but it's been so ingrained in me that it's hard to kick it.
      How long would it take to pick a part, codify, implement, and internalize everything that i've "learned"?
      probably more than my remaining lifetyime.
      There's just so much god dammed information.
      so much shit to sort through.
