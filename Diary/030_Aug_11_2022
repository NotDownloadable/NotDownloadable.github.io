		  Today has been a strange day.
      I woke up feeling ok.
      But, now I feel a little meh? I guess.
      It's definitely more bad than good.
      It definitely isn't neutral.
      I haven't been writing all day because I wanted to keep track of the time.
      But was afraid that if I started writing and then stopped that the times would be wrong.
      Like, if I wrote one sentence, got up , fucked off for an hour or something and then came back.
      I would feel wierd making another entry to reflect the advance of time.
      But, I guess that doesn't really matter does it?
      Just another stupid hangup to get over, I suppose.

      I was thinking about "Communication - Intro" from Ender Lilies earlier today.
      I like that track.
      I wanted to try to be productive at work today.
      But, it seems my work friends had other plans.
      Granted, I could have told them off, but I wanted to goof off too.
      Even now, I'm technically goofing off.
      I'm not doing my job.
      Nor am I advancing any personal goals.
      I'm just looking at the ceiling and typing away.
      I try not to look at the keyboard, otherwise I get hung up on every litt word and piece of punctuation.

      It's hard wantintg to be a creative.
      I run a D&D game for friends, but always scope too large.
      I want them to have a great experience and feel bad not rewarding a 25 skill check with something cool.
      I don't think I have enough creativity and sources to continuously pump out content like that.
      Escpecially not for every good roll.

      I have a headache now.
      How many times have I looked at my pohne?
      Too many. That's for sure.
      When was teh last time I wore down a pencil, or ran out of ink?
      It makes me sad to think about how little drafting I've actually done in any sense.
      I know that I shouldn't wallow in self pity.
      I'm trying not to.
      Maybe that's not even true.
      Maybe I've become so accustomed to it, that I can't imagine otherwise.
      I just need to make more right?
      Write mroe right?
      That's all.
      This is something.
      It's not I want to make, but it's something , right?
      I just need to keep writing, keep making, keep doing.

      How do I get control of my mind?
      What do I need to do?
      Maybe i should try doing nothing.
      But, i can't even bring myself to do that.
      How hard is it to do literally nothing.
      It's so hard.
      There's always something that needs to be done.
      And I never want to do it.
      My job stresses me out so much.
      So much needs to be done.
      I feel like I'm faking it.
      I can't keep this up for the rest of my life.
      It won't work.
      It's not feasible.
      And I hella don't want to do it.
      I want to actually live at some point.
      I just need something.
      Something.
      But, I don't know what I need or if I need it or what, but I need something.
      right
      Just keep tyipng. Just keep swimming.

      I'm so hungry.
      I'm always hungry.
      I made Dijon Mustard salad dressing today.
      Few measurements and it came out good.
      It's whatever, but it's on the good side of whatever.

      How much money do I need to be free?
      When will I have that money?
      I don't have the energy for a politcal rant.
      So much that owe people.
      So much to do.
      It's all too much to hold onto.
      Almost checked my phone again.
      So tired. So sleepy.
      My brain is exhausted.
      Is that a good enough reason to stop?
      It's so cold.

      It'sall in me head. It's all in me head.
      Taht's what I keep telling myself.
      But reality won't let me go.
      Nowhere to run.
      Trapped in a prison.
      What happens to people?
      How does the world affect these folks? (Myself included.)

      Everything is way too loud.
      The door opening and closing so violently.
      The call of sleep.
      My stomach rumbling for food.
