    <p>
      I.
      I don't know what to think anymore.
      I'm taking a break from doing my job, but there's nothing that I want to do.
      I tried working on D&D stuff.
      I've put so much effort into it already.
      You'd think I'd be glad to have some time to push it towards fruition.
      But, no.
      It's a chore.
      I feel nothing.
      Nothing but annoyance.
      What's wrong with me?
      Why is joy so hard to feel?
      Why can't I just enjoy things?
      I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KszmrMQYYNw">H20:HCL</a> from OMORI, because of course it's from OMORI.
      I'm so empty.
      "There is nothing here."
      I don't enjoy anything anymore.
      I know that I don't enjoy what I'm doing.
      But, what else is there for me to do?
      I can't.
      I just can't.
      Is life worth living if I don't get to start moving towards experiencing a modicrum of happiness until I turn 40?
      What's the point.
      It's all downhill from there anyways, isn't it?
      Where's the hope?
      Things are happening now.
      Things I would like to be a part of, I think.
      But, no.
      I'm here doing a job because if I don't I'll die.
      I don't dislike working.
      I just wish I could give a shit, or do something worthwhile or be less alone while doing the things I do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What did I do wrong?
      Am I the only one tortured like this?
      How is everyone else ok?
      I will never understand.
      Was I born wrong?
      Did I build wrong?
      What happened?
      Maybe I should max out my <a href="https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Inland_Empire">InlandEmpire</a> and give in to the <a href="https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/ROUTES">HikikOmori</a> route.
      I see the appeal.
      It's so much easier.
      I'm so sick of trying.
      I'm so tired of getting nowhere.
      What did I do wrong?
      What am I doing wrong?
      Maybe my mistake was to play at all.
      I didn't ask to be here.
      Why not quit?
      It's so cold.
      I'm following the instructions:

    </p>
    
    <p>
      Why would anyone care?
      Why should anyone care?
      Am I the cause of all of my suffering?
      Am I not doing enough to warrant release?
      Am I capable of doing enough to escape?
      I think I would prefer to have died.
      I don't need you to tell me that I'm ungrateful.
      I do it enough to myself.
      Even now.
      Which one is teh real me?
      I feel this way most often.
      Life is a chore.
      Existence is pain.
      Death is not an abstinence, but a release from obligation.
      Freedom.
      That's whay I'm all about, right?
      Freedom.
      Where do I go?
      What do I do?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Am I retarded?
      I use the word <a href="https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/learnedhelplessness.pdf">specifically for a reason</a>.
      Retardation is the slowing of a development.
      To be retarded would mean to have had your development slowed.
      It's most often used in the context of a birth defect.
      But, who says that's the only cause?
      Maybe I'm just making excuses.
      Maybe I'm actually just weak an should be culled.
      Maybe me getting this far was a mistake.
      Not just for the world, but for me.
      Maybe it would have been better if I had died earlier.
      Because now, I can't keep up anymore.
      It's dark. So dark.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I eat not terribly.
      I used to exercise a decent amount.
      And even then others still seemed to be better off than me.
      Now I have back pain and heartburn and...
    </p>
    
    <h2>10:15 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      Again, I am paralyzed.
      There is so much to do.
      So much I want to do.
      But, I can't choose.
      Despite my attempt to implement a system to remedy it, I have failed.
      I'll try again, to be sure.
      But, right now, I feel adrift.
      Pressured.
      Confused.
      And so, I write this entry instead.
      I feel like my dreams are like the moon.
      They feel so close that it looks like I can just reach out and touch it.
      But, the reality is much less exciting.
      My dreams are really thousands of miles of boring shuttle ride away.
      Maybe I should take a train and just live on a train for a while.
      That doesn't sound too bad.
    </p>
    
    <h2>11:50 PM UTC</h2>
    <p>
      I've always been a late bloomer.
      Most people started their edgey phase around 12 or 14.
      I didn't start mine until I turned 19.
      Have you ever been standing by the side of the road just before a bunch of cars go rushing by and thought:
      "All I have to do is jump forward suddenly and I can get out."
      Or had a similar thought while looking up at a 7 floor parking garage?
      It'd be so easy wouldn't it.
      I just wish I wouldn't have to deal with the regret shit that everyone says kicks in.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt21dU5Pu8g">View From Halfway Down</a> and all that shit.
