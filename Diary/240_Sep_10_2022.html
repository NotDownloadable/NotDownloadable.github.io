      I'm listening to a cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIAvqmEPldU">Long Way</a> from Persona 4.
      It's soothing.
      I've always like Long Way.
      This cover of it, although messy, has an energy that I love.
      Mildly upbeat, yet relaxed.
      Adachi is one of my favorite characters in any piece of media, and an vital figure in the development of my identity.
      The YouTube channel SugarPunch has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qG8Mqe_1v8">a video on him</a> that I largely agree with.
      There are some key differences in my view of Adachi,the conclusions the game draws about him, and how they fit in our world.
      <abbr title="This might as well be my catchphrase at this point. Always later.">That's for another time, though.</abbr>

      I'm not feeling horrible today.
      I'm not neutral.
      I'm still quite stressed.
      But, I am somewhat calm.
      Things are "OK", if only for a moment.
      There are times when I forget.
      <abbr title="Or at least who I think I am at any given moment.">I forget who I am.</abbr>
      I forget what I want.
      I forget what I'm doing.
      I forget that the future is not the present.
      And I forget that life and death are both whatever.
      Don't get me worng.
      <abbr title="And strong ones at that.">I still have feelings.</abbr>
      Hell, a couple hours ago I hurt myself acknowledging that one of my coworkers is better at the <abbr title="They're better at life in general and are infinitely more equiped to both handle and enjoy life than I will ever be, so there's that, too.">job</abbr> that I don't care about than I am.
      It was a relatively small blip, though.
      I shouted a little soliloquy and moved past it.
      It might be more difficult once I'm in the office again, though.
      I thought about how my negative aspects are a part of me.
      That's just the unfortunate reality of my existence.
      I'll have to carry all of the brokeness and emptiness with me for as long as I remain conscious.
      It sucks.
      It hurts.
      But, I am carrying it.
      And, maybe someday, I'll adapt and stomach it and take my finger off the eject button.
