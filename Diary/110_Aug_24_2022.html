    <p>
      I really have not been able to finish a thought these past few days.
      I would consider all of those entries to be "incomplete".
      But, I'm goin to let them be.
      Maybe I'll read them and elaborate on the ideas in them, if I'm in the mood.
      If not, whatever.
      This is my corner and all that.
      Incompleteness and mistakes abound.
      I'm not feeling horrible today.
      I don't think I'll finish this entry either.
      I'm trying to be more disciplined aobut my work habbits.
      I recalled a study that said the optimal work-to-break ration is 52 minutes of work to 17 minutes of rest.
      This is about a 3:1 ratio.
      I don't think I can sustainably handle that right now.
      So, I'm starting with a 1:1 ratio.
      30 minutes of work.
      30 minutes of break.
      Suboptimal? Sure.
      But, at east it lets me both feel like I'm getting stuff done and giving me room to breathe.
      I ordered the family of tasks I wanted to work on and have just been looping through them.
      I feel kind of tired, but like workout tired, I think.
      I'm not exactly certain.
      It could be a tiredness that I'm not used to, but it feels like the tiredness you get when you start working out again after a while.
      That kind of thing, so I think it's just a "growing pain" of sorts.
      Hope I can make it stick.

      I've been thinking about my world and my environment.
      I don't like it for a variety of reasons.
      I thinkk it's too small, I'm too vulnerable, my connections don't feel quality, and my needs aren't met.
      I dread waking up and going to my job, my living quarters don't reflect me at all and feel impermenant, my friends are out friends of convenience, and I constantly have a lurking burbling feeling of wanting to kill myself.
      I could try to "go somewhere" that is more in line with what I think I need.
      But, i don't think that place exists.
      Granted I haven't looked, bu tI'm just ranting about feelings so fucking relax.
      I think I've mentioned t his before, but I also don't feel like I have anything to contribute, so I wouldn't be good for that community.
      Nor, would I be able to actually enjoy its benefits.
      I want to create my own world.
      This is similar to teh idea of the entry a few days ago.
      We'll see.
      I'm really just going to keep chugging along because the reality is that I have nothing else to do.
      Or rather, that there is nothing else that I can do.
      I'd love to spend my time making art and working on other personal projects and improving my skills, but that doesn't pay and iI don't ahve a Theodore to support me while I wallow in my sadness.
      Fuck, I have to start working again. It's the top of the hour.
      Oh well.
      Again, hope I can keep this up and make my environment better.
      Maybe I'll continue this entry later, maybe I won't.
      Not like it matters really.

      I missed on of my work windows.
      Off to a bad start.
      I was listening to a couple of my coworkers talk.
      Fuck my brain sucks.
      I can't focus when there are distractions.
      I can't focus when there aren't distractions.
      I don't even know if there's a middle ground somewhere.
      Oh well.
      Sucks to suck, I guess.
      Maybe this is a good time to circle back to the Infinite thing I was talking about yesterday.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The short version is that I always feel like everyone else can just "do stuff" and succeed with whatever they're given.
      I always need so much more.
      I feel like I'm weak and stupid and have a bunch of handicaps that I don't actually know if I have.
      Maybe I'm just being dramatic, which bugs me.
      But, I don't know.
      Most other people that I interact with just "work".
      They're like code that runs right on the first try.
      Everything I do feels like a fucking struggle into failure.
      I try helping?
      It wasn't actually needed and the issue got resolved by someone else or before I finished.
      I try to be useful?
      I fuck it up and prove that I am actually a liability waste of space.
      I'm just a fucking failure.
      But, I can't even have the sense to fail forward or whatever.
      I don't even think I had it that bad.
      Sure, myparents kind of sucked and I had no freedome, wasn't supported, wasnt' socialized, and was not encouraged to explore my hobbies, but instead forced to stay inside because goin outside was dangerous while also being berated for the activities that I engaged in while inside, and never receiving guidance on what I should do, but instead only being told to "achieve" some vaguely "positive end goals" with no direction.
      But, there are people out there who had it much worse and are somehow doing better than me.
      They're more accomplished, more skilled, happier.
      Clearly the problem is just me.
      I don't know what to do about it though.
      I'm normally against essentialist arguments, but always apply them to myself.
      I'm so used to it.
      I don't know when that became the case, but it is the case.
      I'm not sure if i purposefully made this entry take such a negative turn or what, but here we are.
      That's just my brain I guess.
      negative, self hating, critical, and predisposed to negativity and spirraling.
      I don't understand how other people can do it.
      How can they be happy and do things.
      Why am I always the one "out o fmy element".
      What even is my element.
      I've never known.
      i've always sucked at everything.
      Maybe I'm just stupid inherently.
      What's teh point.
      I want to be able to be happy one day and look at these entries and see them and the feelings iI feel as a distant memory.
      But, now, it doesn't feel like it ever will be.
      Here I am complaining about nothing.
      Well, it is something, but nothing compared to what others go through and have gone through.
      I still remember teh valedictorian of my high school class.
      Their life was exponentially rougher than mine.
      Yet, they were so much more effective.
      Better grades, better projects, better hobies.
      They just were (and still are) better than me.
      I try and try, but I keep failing.
      On the bright side you could argue "keep trying that's what matters as long as you don't give up."
      Sure, and I agree.
      But, fuck does it feel bad.
      I just want to win at some point.
      I can't even lose enjoyably.
      i feel like <a href="">Dr.Nefarious</a> in <a href="">Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</a>.
