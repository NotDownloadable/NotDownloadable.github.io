      I feel a certain misery.
      It's a realization that everything is grinding to a halt.
      That things aren't working they way that they should or that I want.
      Knowing that "it's not too late to fix it", but feeling that it is.
      Every turn I think I'm doing good enough only to find out that I'm not.
      I'm actually insufficient and inferior and behind in every way by every metric.
      This feeling of hoplessness.
      Despair.
      Criticizing myself in my head for whining and not fixing it, even when I'm trying my damndest to fix it.
      "One thing at a time." I tell myself.
      Only for one thing at a time to be to slow.
      Even though I know that "one thing at a time" can become "two things at a time",
      or at the very least "one thing at a time in rapid succession", but we've gotten this far and that hasn't happened, yet.
      So, it feels like it never will.
      We try and try and try and yet we're no better off than we were when we started.
      The circumstances around of have changed, sure, but we're still the same.
      We still have nothing we want.
      Hell, we may have even less now.
      What's the point.
      Will it ever get better?
      Will we ever get better?
      How right can we be?
      How right is anyone?
      And yet, they're always more right than me.
      I can hear them in my head.
      "Oh boo hoo poor you!"
      "Not this again."
      "Just be better."
      "I don't understand why you're having such a hard time with this."
      "Oh you're doing the thing? Guess you're all better now and that it wasn't so bad."
      They're all so loud.
      So loud.
