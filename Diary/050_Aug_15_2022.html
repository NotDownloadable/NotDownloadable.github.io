    <p>
      I am feeling the overwhelmed.
      Pathetic, methinks.
      But, that's how I'm feeling.
      So many things that need to be done.
      I have to maintain my job tasks,
      go gorccery shopping and prepare food,
      clean my room and the kitchen,
      complete my job tasks and training,
      complete my personal daily tasks,
      prepare for classes and manage loan deferment, and
      maintain a D&D campaign.
      Looking at it written out, it doesn't seem so bad.
      But, it's all the steps that go into each of those things.
      I find it difficult to focus on one, because as soon as I do, I feel bad because I think I should be doing another.
      There's always so much going on and yet nothing is happening.
      Oh! And I have to reply a bunch of people to upkeep relationships.
      That's hella tiring.
      I wish I could just have a month where no one expects anything from me.
      That'd be great.
      Selfish, I know.
      But, it'd be great.
      Being allowed to actually do nothing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There's a certain cerenity in doing nothing and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Jp2mlzEjw">sitting in silence</a>.
      Like the end of the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of_Metal">Sound of Metal</a>.
      I have no personal connection to either of those links; they just have space in my recent mind for one reason or another.
      Sitting in silence makes me uncomfortable.
      That's kind of what I like about it.
      Even now, I want to turn on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ7WohjhJjA">Communication - Intro</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Lilies:_Quietus_of_the_Knights">Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights</a>
      or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBLUzDzMNLg">Pianobin's piano arrangement of OMORI</a>.
      Oh the dread of being asked "What are you doing?" and not being allowed to say "Nothing. And I want to keep it that way."
      I dread the question most from my manager.
      So much emptiness that needs to be completed.
      I'm tempted to type *Sigh*, but that seems a little "edgy" and I would probably type it enough times that it would become annoying.
      At the same time, what does it matter?
      Fuck you, right?
      Like I said, this is my corner.
      Go somewhere.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Fuck, I love music.
      I looked up the Pianobin OMORI arrangement to get the link for the above paragraph.
      Also looked up Communication - Intro for the same reason.
      Saw a recommended video for a piece by the Ender Lilies composer.
      I guess it's called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNTytQzh_E">Inhibition</a> and it's a remaster.
      I like it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have so many things that I want to express.
      At least I think I do.
      I often don't feel that I am particularly creative.
      Let alone do I actually create anything.
      I think I'm bad at doing things, because I'm bad at doing nothing.
      I always feel like I have to do <a href="https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/SOMETHING">Something</a> and thus end up accomplishing nothing.
      Jumping from one task to another to keep up appearances for others or myself and doing nothing meaningful.
      God, I feel so empty.
      Would I be creative if I spent time creating?
      Just having at it and throwing ideas at the wall over and over and over again and keeping what I liked while discarding what I didn't?
      Would I actually do that if I had the time?
      If I weren't worried about debt and obligations?
      That's not how our world works.
      I know.
      People create even with obligations.
      I don't know how they do it, though.
      How does one quiet their mind and slave away at a thing until they like it?
      Would it be different if I already had the skills that I wanted?
      What could I have been? What could I still be?
      I don't want to die in this job.
      I don't want to grow old in this job.
      But, my mind won't listen to me.
      The distractions. The feelings of obligation. The necessities. The upkeep.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Is what's in my head even worth expressing?
      Who would care?
      I can't make art just for myself.
      That has no meaning for me.
      I want to connect. So badly.
      I'm so tired of being alone.
      Doing everything myself.
      I don't care for the Bible as a religious document, but it has some damn good lines.
      <em>And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”
And the LORD God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”</em>
      This isn't to say that I need a romantic partner.
      (I think that'd be nice, but I'm not sure how I really feel about it. The coucil is still out on that one.)
      But, it'd be nice to build something with someone.
      What do I have to offer, though?
      Stress and misery and failure.
      Unfulfilled desires and complaints.
      Lament.
      Nothing.
      That's what I have.
      Nothing.
      <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Kefka_Palazzo">Where does the time come from? Where does it go?</a>
      (God, I love the style of Final Fantasy art. Not the in-game stuff, the other stuff.)
      (Like the art done for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoji_Shinkawa">Metal Gear Solid and Zone of the Enders</a>.)
      I found another neat track in the recommended.
      It's called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZjpkJ_A3Jo">eternal existence</a>.
      It's long and stuff just keeps happening.
      I didn't care for it much at first, but it's growing on me.
      Because, at least it goes somewhere.
      I was going to save the links, before I realized that I already have.
      They're right there.
      Above these lines.
      What a world.
      It's a shame that my pattern will have to end one day.
      Likely without anyone ever really experiencing it.
      Then again, perhaps it's for the best.
      What good has my pattern done anyone thus far?
      Indifference.
      That is the name of my pattern.
      Maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCQjrW0ofRE">"Mediocrity"</a>?
      (I didn't realize that Salieri did Motzart's laugh at the end there. Great touch.)
      Either is fine.
      Perhaps I am giving myself to much credit, even in that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      How about another track from the recommended?
      It's called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yfprENhw9A">lasting entropy</a> by zynzvn.
      I'm playing <a href="">Semantle</a> with a friend.
      And have clicked another song in the recommended.
      This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbYva7AE8Aw">Victim</a> by FUZI and Mili.
