      Another day another dollar, I guess.
      I'm not feeling too bad right now.
      I'm thinking about owo bot and "My Time" by bo en.

      It's odd.
      I want people to listen to me, but I don't want to be heard.
      I feel like I have thoughts in my head that are worth expressing.
      Thoughts that someone might like to know.
      But, I don't feel coherent.
      I'm just babbling about nothing.
      When I'm talking to myself, it all seems clear.
      But, when I say it to someone else or write with the possibility of someone finding it and reading it, then it all seems so stupid and ridiculous.
      Like I'm an idiot for even considering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it matter though?
      Who's going to find this poorly written unformatted wall of text hosted in a github repository?
      No one. That's who.
      I can sit in this corner and talk as much as I want.
      And although there is a chance that someone will hear me, it's next to zero.
      The chance of them listening is even lower.
      It's perfect.
      I can babble and babble and babble and experience the fear of being heard all while never having it come to fruition.
      Granted, the same could be said of a personal page on another hosting site like Twitter or Medium or Wordpress or Tumblr or something.
      But, here? This is my corner.
      Someone would have to work really hard to find this plane of existence.
      And why would they?
      <a href="https://www.omori-game.com/">There is nothing here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Will it all make sense one day?
      I hope so.
      Just keep typing and something will eventually come out.
      That's how babies work isn't it?
      Babble and bobble and make as much judgment free noise as you can into the ether, and eventually you'll say something that folks recognize as a word.

      I think that I want to spend Christmas alone this year.
      That's not really true.
      But, at the same time it is.
      I want to spend Christmas with someone other than my family.
      But, I still want the Christmas to have that "warm and meaningful" vibe.
      I'm not close enough with anyone to warrant that though, methinks.
      Maybe it would be better to just spend it alone.

      I'm scared to stop talking (typing) because I have a feeling that once I commit this file to the branch, I'll be too hesitant to change it.
      But, I want to save my progress.
      What a stupid conondrum.
      I'm going to commit it now.
      So, everything after this will be an "edit", technically.
