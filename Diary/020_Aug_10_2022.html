      Another day another dollar, I guess.
      I'm not feeling too bad right now.
      I'm thinking about owo bot and "My Time" by bo en.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's odd.
      I want people to listen to me, but I don't want to be heard.
      I feel like I have thoughts in my head that are worth expressing.
      Thoughts that someone might like to know.
      But, I don't feel coherent.
      I'm just babbling about nothing.
      When I'm talking to myself, it all seems clear.
      But, when I say it to someone else or write with the possibility of someone finding it and reading it, then it all seems so stupid and ridiculous.
      Like I'm an idiot for even considering it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it matter though?
      Who's going to find this poorly written unformatted wall of text hosted in a github repository?
      No one. That's who.
      I can sit in this corner and talk as much as I want.
      And although there is a chance that someone will hear me, it's next to zero.
      The chance of them listening is even lower.
      It's perfect.
      I can babble and babble and babble and experience the fear of being heard all while never having it come to fruition.
      Granted, the same could be said of a personal page on another hosting site like Twitter or Medium or Wordpress or Tumblr or something.
      But, here? This is my corner.
      Someone would have to work really hard to find this plane of existence.
      And why would they?
      <a href="https://www.omori-game.com/">There is nothing here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Will it all make sense one day?
      I hope so.
      Just keep typing and something will eventually come out.
      That's how babies work isn't it?
      Babble and bobble and make as much judgment free noise as you can into the ether, and eventually you'll say something that folks recognize as a word.
    </p>

      I think that I want to spend Christmas alone this year.
      That's not really true.
      But, at the same time it is.
      I want to spend Christmas with someone other than my family.
      But, I still want the Christmas to have that "warm and meaningful" vibe.
      I'm not close enough with anyone to warrant that though, methinks.
      Maybe it would be better to just spend it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm scared to stop talking (typing) because I have a feeling that once I commit this file to the branch, I'll be too hesitant to change it.
      But, I want to save my progress.
      What a stupid conondrum.
      I'm going to commit it now.
      So, everything after this will be an "edit", technically.

        I like links.
        The way they create a web of stuff is fascinating to me.
        I can reference something in this writing and direct the reader directly to it.
        For example: I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWH_uAFl_JI">"Shut Up and Dance in Paradise"</a> by TripleQ.
        They really are genius in their mashups.
        At least in my mind.
        Very much appeals to the culture that I think I'm most affiliated with.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm still hesitant to keep typing, because I'm not saying anything.
        In fact, I think I'm just repeating myself with the occassional nothing.
        But, there is a lot of stuff that will be left on the cutting room floor, right?
        If I want to make things, then I have to start somewhere and be consistent.
        I have thoughts on that, but don't want to go into it here.
        Right now I'm think about how I dislike using the word "just" and how I start many of my sentences with a conjunction and a comma.
        Like "But,"; "And,"; and "So,".
        Maybe it's a mark of style?
        Maybe it's a flaw?
        I don't know.
        Maybe I shouldn't worry about it right now, because I haven't actually done anything and need to do stuff before worrying about quality.
        Which, sure there is nuance and this isn't true ALL of the time, but I think it is for me.
      </p>

        I do this thing where I read a lot and study, but don't actually put my work into practice.
        As if reading and taking notes on a subject are the same as doing it.
        I've learned the hard way that they are not.
        So much time wasted.
        I want all of the notetaking to payoff, but I don't think it will.
        At least not to the extent that I want it to.
        I can be certain that it won't pay off if I don't do anything with it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Prime example.
        I've known about HTML and generally how to use tags for a while now.
        Yet, here I am barely marking the page and not formatting anything.
        I completed both <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3Schools'</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp's</a> CSS tutorials.
        Hardly a clue where to begin to format this nonsense in a way that I want.
        I'm not even sure how I want to format it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm terrified of not implementing "best practices" from the get go.
        Even on something as meaningless as this it still irks me.
        I can feel the twinges in my chest and breath and mind.
        I just want it to be "good".
        I spent hours cutting my own flashcards to a size that I like (playing card size) and don't use them.
        There are 3 reasons I don't:
        
        <ol>
          <li>I don't know what to use them for</li>
          <li>I'm scared to ruin them and waste the perfect blank cards</li>
          <li>I'm too lazy to actually design the cards and write what needs to go on them</li>
        </ol>
      
      I just put that "Ordered List" inside the "Paragraph" element and don't know what's going to happen.
      I can have just made a massive blunder, and I won't know until I publish and refresh the page a bunch.
      So, I going to commit and check that now.
