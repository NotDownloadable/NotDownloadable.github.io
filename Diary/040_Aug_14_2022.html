      I don't care much for Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
      The first time I watched through it, I found it kind of irritating.
      I think I still do.
      The idea that one can achieve anything if they just feel strongly enough about it and keep pushing.
      Don't get me wrong.
      Pushing is a vital part of achievement.
      And the show does make a point of demonstrating that pushing isn't always enough.
      Kamina does die in episode 8 after all. (SPOILERS)
      But, the show doesn't do enough to demonstrate what is enough.
      It doesn't recognize it and call it out.
      It's all determination.
      Forget all the engineers and bureaucrats and day-to-day people.
      We're heroes and defenders and our hearts beat as one and determination and never surrender blah blah blah.
      Who needs logistics and strategy.
      Granted, that's not what the show is for.
      It doesn't want to be that nuanced.
      Fine.
      I'm just saying what about it bothered me.
    </p>

      For all of that ranting, there was one character I liked a lot.
      <a href="https://gurrenlagann.fandom.com/wiki/Viral">Viral</a>.
      I related to his yearning to just be enough.
      To be enough and be happy.
      That's all.
      He doesn't really get it in the end.
      I don't want to go into a whole essay on it right now, so I'll table that for another time.
    </p>

      I made quite the discovery today.
      I am addicted to a lot of things.
      I'm addicted to sugar.
      I'm addicted to YouTube.
      I'm addicted to milling about.
      So many behaviors that I resort to that make me miserable.
      
      I took a break from sugar for about a week.
      I used stevia as a substitute sweetener and lamented the dietary restrictions I had placed on myself.
      Today, I ate so much junk.
      It felt good.
      Now I feel bad.
      And not just physical stomach ache and heartburn bad.
      But emotionally and mentally bad.
      I don't want to live like this.
      I don't want to grow old and weak and shuffle arond with achey bones.
      I want to stay young forever.
      And eat whatever I want.
      Healthy stuff and junk.
      (Even I need a break from junk at some point.)
      But that's not how the world works is it?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I stil had more to say in that last section, but this is my diary.
      Who decided that I have to write about all the things I want to write about in order and without breaking to something else?
      No more.
      Now I'm thinking about how lonely I am.
      I return to my house that isn't a home and there is no one and nothing there to greet me.
      I have nothing to go back to.
      I enter my room and now type into the GitHub text editor.
      I wonder how many others are out there.
      All in their own corners of the internet and corners of the world, lonely, and screaming into the void.
      <a href="https://www.zenpencils.com/comic/leary/">How do I find those people</a>
      Do I even want to talk to them?
      I want to an art show last week.
      August 6th, 2022.
      It was for OMORI.
      I thought "This is it. If there's a place I can make a friend it'll be here."
      How wrong I was.
      All those approaches and prompts and tries all to end up empty handed.
      I'm not saying I'm owed the reward of friendship for expending the energy of approaching someone.
      I'm not that stupid or entitled.
      But it still feels bad when the Skinner box doesn't give you the treat.
      That's all.
      (Again, even though I use the Skinner box analogy, I don't believe all relationships are do X to get Y. Come on.)
      I'm just so tired of feeling alone and isolated and...
      I feel like I'm in this unpleasant middle ground where I'm too weird for normal people and too normal for weird people.
      I just want a place to call home.
      I wouldn't mind starting a cult.
      Think I'd be not too bad at that.
    </p>

      The world is a scary place.
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/27QBppG8UuQ8pRlbgIUPn4">I just want it to be less scary.</a>
      (I like Rise Against a lot, but that's not one of their songs I listen to much. It was just relevant to the topic.)
      I still want the world to be thrilling.
      Just less frightening.
      More Saturday Morning Cartoon villain.
      That's all.
      What a scary place.
      Why's it all so big.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onplsJSdp4A">It's too much to hold onto.</a>
    </p>

      I really like using links.
      It's so comprehensive.
      It's like sewing or weaving.
      Slowly but surely explaining the meager tapestry that is me.
      One link at a time.
      Granted they don't appear in order of importance, but they are there, right?
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__d2FMCtgi4">One at a time.</a>
      I can show you all the nonsense that goes on in my mind and how my neurons fire.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I wish I could have some time where no one had any expecations of me.
      No expecatations to perform work.
      No expectations to respons to messages or return phone calls.
      Just me and whatever I wanted.
      No obligations.
      I would love some time to just, be.
      I wish I didn't feel like I need a vaccation from existing.
      I use the term existing, because I don't think you can call the thing I do or have "life".
      Life is a vacation with work in the middle.
      My existence is a job with work on the side.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZc1V67XzNw">No peace.</a>
