      Another day another dollar.
      Or however that saying goes.
      I need to learn to be kinder to myself.
      It's hard to do when teh world is so cruel.
      not jus tt ome but to everyone in general.
      Or at least most people..
      Maybe some people just handle it better, somehow.
      Either way.
      I was beating myself up yesterday for not following my 1:1 work:play ration all the way through the day.
      But you know what?
      I made it through some of it, and I'm doing it again today, even though there was a rough start.
      I'm still here and I'm still going and I'm still at it.
      That counts for something right?
      At least for now.
      Potential is worthless if it isn't actualized.

      I want to try writing an essay, but some of teh topics are just so big and burgeon out of scope.
      I know the key o that is to edit and curate, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet.
      Hell, I barely get through these thought dump diary entries.
      And when I type them, I might not finish.
      And then I don't go back and edit it or whatever, which is not the point, but would need to be done for a proper essay for thoughts to be coherent.
      I know that I tied writing a few, but I faded away from them both.
      I think I might have one on this computer, but I'm not sure where it is.
      Let me look for it real quick...
      Oh shit, I found it!
      But it's not actually saved as a file.
      I have the ramblings in the memory of Notepad++.
      Dangerous.
      Let's save it now.

      So much for being kinder to myself or writing an essay.
      I tried a cookie recipie and messed it up because I didn't realize coconut flour was significantly drier than other flowers.
      It's a small thing, but I still feel like an idiot.
      If only because the only thing that comes of it is knowing this quirk about coconut flour and it will probably never be useful or a worthwhile lesson to have learned.
      To top it off, the cookies will probably be shit, too.
      I feel like I'm always the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">ButtMonkey</a> of the group.
      Like I'm the universes <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a>, but without the sypathy and screen presence of a villain.
      I'm just an ineffectual nobody.
      I'm leaning hard into the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobie</a> here, but that's how I feel.
      Waiting for the time I get to be cool and competent and effective and mean something.
