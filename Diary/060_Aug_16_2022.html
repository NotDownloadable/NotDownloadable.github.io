    <p>
      I thought about what tasks I need to complete.
      The moment I went to start one I became paralyzed.
      I started thinking about all th eohter tasks I should do insted.
      All the things that need to et done.
      Fucking ridiculous.
      Why is it so damn difficult to just take an action and go with it?
      Instead, here I am tyiping away in a github entry that took even more time to setup , because I don't keep a template ready, because I'm a fucking clown.
      God damnit.
      I'm so sick of thinking about doing things.
      I know "Just do it."
      Thanks. Haven't heard that before.
      And all this time I spend wondering if there's more to it.
      Fuckk.
      What's wrong with me.
      Just be good dammit.
      Just do a thing. Come on already.
